Here's the story of how we stopped worrying about perfect analytics and started making actual money.\n\n\nGoogle Analytics has this way of making you feel simultaneously overwhelmed and underwhelmed:\nConfused Math GIFfrom Confused GIFs \nOverwhelmed by the sheer amount of data, underwhelmed by how little of it actually matters. After spending weeks diving deep into analytics tools and metrics, we learned that sometimes the most valuable data isn't in your analytics dashboard at all.\nBackground\nDuring the Statistics and Data Analysis course, our team of three had an ambitious plan: analyze website metrics across three different projects:\n\nA new Business Academy website\nOur course cooperative's digital agency site\nA casino affiliate website aggregating Latvian casinos (mansbonuss.com)\n\nThe goal was to compare metrics across different types of websites and extract meaningful insights. However, as often happens in the real world, our plans took an interesting turn.\nPlans Change GIFfrom Plans GIFs \nThe Analytics Landscape\nAfter researching and testing different analytics solutions, here's what we learned about each:\nGoogle Analytics 4 (GA4)\nThe Good:\n\nFree with unlimited events\nDeep integration with Google's ecosystem\nAdvanced user behavior tracking\nCustom event tracking\nMachine learning insights\n\nThe Bad:\n\nComplex implementation for custom events\nSignificant learning curve\nData sampling on free tier\nPrivacy concerns with GDPR\nHistorical data limited to 14 months\n\nMeta Pixel (Facebook Pixel)\nThe Good:\n\nExcellent for ad campaign tracking\nDetailed demographic data\nBuilt-in event tracking\nGood for retargeting\nReal-time data\n\nThe Bad:\n\nLimited to Meta's ecosystem\nPrivacy concerns (iOS 14.5+ impact)\nRequires user consent\nNot great for general analytics\nCan affect site performance\n\nPlausible Analytics\nThe Good:\n\nSimple, clean interface\nPrivacy-focused (EU-hosted)\nNo cookie consent needed\nFast loading (under 1KB)\nEasy to understand metrics\n\nThe Bad:\n\nPaid only (€9/month minimum)\nBasic event tracking\nNo user-level data\nLimited custom reporting\nNo raw data access\n\nMatomo (formerly Piwik)\nThe Good:\n\nFull data ownership\nGDPR compliant out of the box\nSimilar features to GA\nNo data sampling\nFlexible hosting options\n\nThe Bad:\n\nResource-intensive if self-hosted\nComplex setup for custom tracking\nHigher costs at scale\nLimited community support\nLess intuitive than modern tools\n\nOur Analytics Stack Decision\nAfter evaluating our needs and constraints, we ended up on:\n\n\nGoogle Analytics 4 for:\n\nCore website metrics\nUser behavior tracking\nCustom event tracking\nConversion tracking\n\n\n\nMeta Pixel for:\n\nAd campaign performance\nAudience insights\nRetargeting capabilities\nSocial traffic analysis\n\n\n\n(additional) TikTok purhcased views for:\n\nBigger audience reach\nMore precise targeting\nBetter conversion rates\n\n\n\nWhile we didn't use Meta Pixel yet, we're planning to use it in the future for paid ads.\nHere's why GA4 and Meta Pixel is the best choice for us:\n\nCost Efficiency: The free tier is more than enough for our needs\nComplementary Data: GA4 for general analytics, Meta Pixel for social insights\nFuture Proofing: Learning industry-standard tools\nMarketing Potential: Ready for future paid advertising\n\nThe Unexpected Turn\nWhile setting up analytics across our three projects, something interesting happened. Our casino affiliate website started getting real traffic, and more importantly - potential for real revenue. Our focus quickly shifted from pure analytics to:\n\nUnderstanding affiliate partnerships\nTracking conversion rates\nOptimizing for actual revenue\n\nThis wasn't just about numbers anymore - it was about real business opportunities. While we were supposed to be studying statistics, we found ourselves negotiating affiliate deals and optimizing landing pages.\nWhat We Actually Learned\nFrom Analytics:\nHere's what our traffic sources looked like:\n\n\n\nKey insights:\n\nMobile traffic dominated (over 60%)\nUsers spent more time on comparison pages\nOrganic search was our main traffic source\n\nFrom Business Reality:\n\nRevenue potential matters more than perfect analytics\nReal user behavior often surprises you\nBeing flexible with your goals is crucial\n\nThe Tools We Actually Used\nOur final tech stack was simpler than planned:\n// Google Tag Manager for tracking casino clicks\ndataLayer.push({\n'event': 'casino_click',\n'casino_name': 'Example Casino',\n'button_location': 'comparison_table',\n'device_type': 'mobile'\n});\n\n\n\nGoogle Analytics 4: For basic metrics\nGoogle Tag Manager: For event tracking\nGoogle Sheets: For revenue tracking (sometimes simple is best)\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nStart Simple: Don't try to track everything at once\nFollow the Money: When revenue opportunities appear, don't ignore them\nReal Data &gt; Perfect Data: Some insights are better than no insights\nStay Flexible: Your initial plan might not survive contact with reality\n\nLooking Forward\nWhile we didn't complete our original analytics comparison across three websites, we ended up learning something more valuable - how to use data to drive real business decisions. Sometimes the best lessons come from the projects that don't go as planned.\nThe casino affiliate website continues to grow, and we're now focusing on:\n\nOptimizing conversion rates\nExpanding our casino partnerships\nUsing data to make better content decisions\nActually making money (turns out this is important)\n\nFinal Thoughts\nOur journey from academic analytics project to potential business venture taught us that while data is important, action is essential. Sometimes the best data insights come from actually building something and seeing what happens.\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I need to go check our conversion rates... or maybe just build another casino comparison table.\nAssess for Success: Marketing Analytics and Measurement\nGoogle Analytics Certification\n","id":"https://notdevkey.github.io/analytics-journey/","title":"From statistics to profit: An unexpected data journey"},"https://notdevkey.github.io/biggest-mistake/":{"body":"Mistakes are good. They imply you're in an uncomfortable place. I was so uncomfortable I left the place. But the place keeps chasing me till this day.\n\n\nYou see, starting a career is always challenging. There's a point where you have to take a leap and start making money with the knowledge you've supposedly gained during the process(I assume) you have spent learning.\nYou try finding a suitable job... and get accepted! Congrats! Now what?\nWhen you start working at a company, you must go through an internship. It's where you show your skills and slowly get accustomed to the work environment you'll be in for quite a while. The internship phase was ambiguous - I was \"learning\" while already working on enterprise software. And let me tell you one thing - it was a disaster.\nYou develop a certain degree of Stockholm syndrome when joining a new company, especially if it's your first time and you're a junior developer(guess what, it's me). Now there are big Chad programmer guys who take you by your hand and lead you through the frameworks and procedures they used to make the software and how they work. And you listen carefully. You fool. No, no, it was me; I was the fool...\nThat's what internships are all about - learning from the better. The worst part is that they could have provided me with excellent and proven tutorials already available on the internet. No. The company CEO was hosting YouTube streams where he taught his ways of software development to innocent students, just like me. The points made in those streams were so far off and contradicted everything I had learned about so far. But I felt like I was enlightened at that moment. I thought, wow, such a unique approach; this must be super efficient!\nHaha, yeah...\nThe disaster\nIt all starts from this. My rant.\nconst { EventEmitter } = require(\"events\");\n\nconst firstEmitter = new EventEmitter();\n\nfirstEmitter.emit(\"My first event\");\n\nYes, that's the most primitive event emitter written in Javascript - the core of all problems.\nDoesn't sound too crazy, but if you know a little about how state management works in React and if I told you that state change was always triggered by events... yeah... the face of disgust.\nThere was no possibility of debugging the code because HTTP requests were being made every 5 seconds, which means... clears throat... asynchronous event-based state changes every single time. And it wasn't just one state that lived happily in one component. It was state triggered across all components. You never knew which one could handle the event first. On top of that, every single React component extended the Node.js EventEmitter class. And the event handler itself was a HUGE class that reached 4k lines of code in one file. Absolute disaster.\nThe redemption\nSoon enough I realized that the codebase was pure insanity. I proposed a different approach to the people in charge of the project management, and the conversation went something like this:\n\n\"Have you ever heard of a tool called React Query? It's a great tool that helps you deal exactly with this problem, but even way better than the framework does it natively.\"\n\"Thanks, I will definitely check it out! 👍\"\n\n(P.S. Nobody ever checked it out)\nSo I tried tackling the problem on my own, to show an example of a much cleaner implementation. Surely someone had to see the difference it makes.\nI'm too lazy to write the example of before and after, so here's just the after:\nfunction Component() {\n    const [text, setText] = useState(\"\");\n\n    const { data: products } = useQuery([\"products\"], async () =&gt; {\n        const { data } = await axios.get(\"...\");\n        return data;\n    });\n\n    return (\n        {products?.map(p =&gt; (\n            &lt;div&gt;\n                {p.name}\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n        ))}\n    );\n}\n\nThis solves one of the main problems - there are no events getting emitted when asynchronous data is received and everything stays tied to the relevant component. On top of that React Query offers caching and other cool features, which usually are pain in the ass to to implement by hand and most likely have to be implemented in your React application. How to avoid it? Just use Svelte instead bro.\nLong story short, I got all my code rewritten by the CEO. And after that, they also decided to keep me away from the essential projects as I caused too much trouble. I ended up working on a poorly written WordPress theme in PHP for the rest of my time in misery.\nThat's when I decided to leave this place for good as there was no space for growth, even though I had no better job prospects at the moment.\nTill this day, I still have nightmares of events emitting uncontrollably, but had I only known those nightmares would soon come to reality...\nThe aftermath\nThe problem is - I live in a small town, and every IT person here knows the CEO. Heck, he even appears all around Latvia. I keep seeing him in every single event I go to.\nI started a student company this year, which involves machine learning concepts. I sought a mentor to guide me through creating such solution. There were no results until one day... The guy texted me, saying he saw this student company on a public spreadsheet working on an AI solution, and asked if I knew the people behind it. Me, excited from being noticed, I proudly let him know it is I, the man himself.\nTwo weeks later I find myself enrolled in a deep learning course of his and also him offering me a \"partnership\" with my student company, where he, in the end of the day, keeps the biggest cut.\nI was crushed. There was no way this could've possibly happened, I thought I had gotten away. No matter which direction I turned, I fell right into his hands.\nYou know, I'm not quite the expert in deep learning, but as far as my concerns go, his way of teaching it wasn't the best either, so I got scared of big formulas and hid away. Never replied to his messages.\nNow, wherever I go, I feel like he's going to appear again out of nowhere and I'll be unknowingly dragged back into the cursed reality.\nWhat can you learn?\nI know I talked so much shit and blamed the poor man for literally doing his job, but all he had to do was listen. Hear out the opinions of other people before diving head-first into writing bloated code(I really hope he's not reading this).\nI'd really have liked to hear his opinion on why my approach is bad, although I understand that the constant pressure from the IT industry constantly evolving can be unbeareable, and it makes you stick to the roots you know work. But that's what teams are for - distribute the pressure to work towards a better solution. But who am I to tell at this point.\nIt's the effort you make towards making a solid connection with people that matters. You could give everything, even pizza and burgers on the weekends(they were pretty good though), but if you don't spend a single dime of your time to show empathy or simple appreciation towards the other person, it will all fall apart.\nAnd be careful not to be misled by others telling you you're doing something wrong. Ask them - why? Do your research, use your own experience, but also remember to listen.\nAnd don't hold me accountable for if anything goes wrong, you shouldn't be listening to a stranger on the internet anyway.\n","id":"https://notdevkey.github.io/biggest-mistake/","title":"The biggest mistake of my early career"},"https://notdevkey.github.io/bookkeeping-cooperative/":{"body":"When starting any business, having a strong bookkeeping system is crucial. This ensures that all financial aspects are tracked, helping your cooperative thrive and make informed decisions. In this blog post, I'll walk you through the basics of bookkeeping and guide you on how to create a bookkeeping system tailored for a cooperative offering digital services such as dropshipping, affiliate programs, eCommerce, SEO, website design, and coding.\nDuring the bookkeeping course in Business Academy, we were in the process for establishing a cooperative legal entity for ourselves, so we could proceed with client acquisition and legally get paid. Our team had one main goal for this course - create a system to keep track of invoices, expenses, and profits.\nFor my course mentor - if you're reading this - the course was really boring, so this blog was really low effort, though it contains all the valuable information I kind of had to find and learn. Hope this changes in the future. Happy reading.\nWhy bookkeeping matters for your cooperative\nBookkeeping isn't just about tracking income and expenses; it's about understanding the financial health of your business. Here's why it's essential:\n\nHelps with budgeting: Knowing where your money goes helps you allocate resources wisely.\nEnsures legal compliance: Proper records help you stay compliant with tax laws and regulations.\nSupports financial decision-making: Accurate data helps make strategic decisions for growth.\nEnhances transparency: For cooperatives, where multiple members contribute and benefit, having a clear financial record fosters trust.\n\nKey elements of a bookkeeping system\nBefore we dive into setting up your system, let's outline the fundamental elements any bookkeeping system should include:\nChart of accounts (COA)\n\nThis is the foundation of your bookkeeping system, categorizing all types of financial transactions.\nCommon categories include assets, liabilities, equity, income, and expenses.\nFor a cooperative focused on digital services, specific income sub-accounts might be \"Website Design Revenue\" or \"Affiliate Program Earnings.\"\n\nGeneral ledger\n\nThe core record where all transactions are logged. This includes everything from client payments to operational expenses.\n\nAccounts Payable and Receivable\n\nAccounts Payable (AP): Keeps track of what your cooperative owes others.\nAccounts Receivable (AR): Monitors payments due from clients for services rendered.\n\nExpense tracking\n\nThis involves recording all outgoing funds, including software subscriptions, marketing costs, and development tools.\n\nInvoices and receipts\n\nKeeping accurate records of issued invoices and receipts ensures consistency and proof of payment.\n\nSteps to create your bookkeeping system\nStep 1: Choose the right software\nThe first step is to pick a bookkeeping software that suits your cooperative's needs. Popular choices include:\n\nQuickBooks: User-friendly and great for small to medium-sized businesses.\nXero: Known for its seamless integrations and ease of use.\nWave: Free option ideal for startups and small teams.\nSpreadsheet tools (e.g., Excel or Google Sheets): Customizable and free, perfect for a starting point if you don't want to invest right away.\n\n\nTip: If your cooperative has varied digital services, make sure your chosen software can handle multiple revenue streams and project tracking.\n\nStep 2: Set up your chart of accounts (COA)\nCreate a chart of accounts tailored to your business activities. Here's a simple breakdown:\nIncome:\n\nDropshipping Revenue\nAffiliate Program Commissions\nSEO Service Fees\nCoding/Development Services\n\nExpenses:\n\nSoftware and Tools (e.g., hosting, SEO tools)\nMarketing and Advertising\nSalaries and Contractor Payments\nMiscellaneous Office Expenses\n\nEach of these should have unique account numbers for easy tracking and reporting.\nStep 3: Record all financial transactions\nEnsure every transaction is recorded in your general ledger. Whether it's an invoice paid by a client for a website design or an expense for purchasing a premium plugin, logging everything will keep your records accurate.\n\nTip: Develop a habit of updating your ledger weekly to avoid last-minute scrambles and missed entries.\n\nStep 4: Implement invoice and receipt management\nFor your cooperative, handling digital services means issuing invoices and tracking client payments is routine. Here's how to manage this effectively:\n\nIssue invoices promptly: Use your bookkeeping software to create and send invoices immediately after a project is completed.\nTrack due dates: Keep a clear list of outstanding payments and follow up with clients as necessary.\nDigitize receipts: Use scanning apps or upload digital receipts directly to your bookkeeping system for easy access and organization.\n\nStep 5: Regular financial reviews\nAssign a team member to review financial records at least once a month. This review should:\n\nVerify that income and expense records are accurate.\nEnsure the cooperative's cash flow is positive.\nIdentify any discrepancies or opportunities to reduce costs.\n\nStep 6: Reporting and analysis\nGenerate monthly or quarterly financial reports to share with your cooperative team. Essential reports include:\n\nProfit and Loss (P&amp;L) Statement: Shows revenue and expenses over a specific period.\nBalance Sheet: Lists assets, liabilities, and equity.\nCash Flow Statement: Demonstrates how money is moving in and out of the cooperative.\n\nThese reports not only help you stay on track but also allow your team to make strategic decisions based on real data.\nTips for success\n\nKeep it simple: Don't overcomplicate your bookkeeping process. Stick to what works best for your cooperative.\nAutomate where possible: Use automation tools to sync your bank accounts and track expenses automatically.\nStay compliant: Ensure your system adheres to local laws, especially regarding taxes and cooperative regulations.\nCommunicate regularly: Since your cooperative is a group effort, maintain open communication about financials with all members.\n\nOur results\nI have to give props to my teammate Timur for creating majority of the system, as I was still working on unfinished sideprojects and was running low on time. He did a great job.\nWe ended up utilizting Google Sheets for invoicing system, since it's free and everyone knows how to use Google Sheets. Maybe it won't be the best for long-term use, but it's a good starting point.\nYou can view the online version of the system here.\nAnd if under some circumstances the linked file disappears, here's a simple view of the invoice table:\n\n    \n        \n            \n                Month\n                Invoice\n                Invoice Number\n                Invoice Type\n                Date\n                Due Date\n                Type\n                Description\n                Client Name\n                Amount (with VAT)\n                VAT\n                Without VAT\n                Payment Method\n                Payment Status\n                Payment Date\n            \n        \n        \n            \n                April\n                [Link to file]\n                PAR-11385-23\n                Variable\n                30.04.2023\n                14.11.2024\n                Incoming\n                Websales\n                LMT\n                288.90 €\n                50.14 €\n                238.76 €\n                Bank transfer\n                Sent / Paid\n                31.10.2024\n            \n            \n                April\n                [Link to file]\n                PAR-11386-23\n                Fixed\n                30.04.2023\n                14.05.2023\n                Outgoing\n                Websales\n                HostingCo\n                30.00 €\n                5.21 €\n                24.79 €\n                Credit Card\n                Sent\n                02.05.2023\n            \n            \n                May\n                [Link to file]\n                PAR-11387-23\n                Variable\n                15.05.2023\n                29.05.2023\n                Incoming\n                SEO Services\n                TechStart Ltd\n                450.00 €\n                78.10 €\n                371.90 €\n                Bank transfer\n                Not Sent\n                25.05.2023\n            \n            \n                May\n                [Link to file]\n                PAR-11388-23\n                Fixed\n                20.05.2023\n                03.06.2023\n                Incoming\n                Web Design\n                GreenCafe\n                750.00 €\n                130.17 €\n                619.83 €\n                Bank transfer\n                Sent / Paid\n                01.06.2023\n            \n            \n                May\n                [Link to file]\n                PAR-11389-23\n                Variable\n                25.05.2023\n                08.06.2023\n                Outgoing\n                Software License\n                Adobe Inc\n                55.00 €\n                9.55 €\n                45.45 €\n                Credit Card\n                Sent / Paid\n                25.05.2023\n            \n        \n    \n\nThis table is horizontally scrollable btw 😎\n\nFinal thoughts\nDeveloping a bookkeeping system might seem daunting at first, but with the right approach and tools, your cooperative can manage its finances effectively. Start with a clear plan, keep your records organized, and review your finances regularly. This will set your team up for smooth operations and future success as you take on new clients and expand your digital service offerings.\nBy setting up a robust bookkeeping system, you're not just keeping track of numbers; you're building a foundation for growth, transparency, and informed decision-making.

I wanted to understand how it works, so I dove into the world of copyrights and royalties. Here's what I found.\n\n\nIf you're a musician, you will find the following GIF very resonating:\nCredit Card GIFfrom Credit GIFs \nYes, that's you paying for all the samples, plugins, and instruments you use to create your music. Not only that, but you also have to pay for advertising and marketing to make people aware of your existence.\nMusic is an expensive hobby. From music production to distribution, marketing, and live shows, there's a lot of costs involved. Most of the time, the money is coming from your own pocket.\nIt doesn't have to be this way, though. You can make money from your music without having to sell merch, play gigs, or even record a single song. In this blog I will talk about how to utilize copyright to make money from your music. These tips range from the obvious to the obscure, especially the not recording a single song part, but they all contribute to the fact that music is a business, and you can make a buck from it.\nBackground\nDuring the the Jurisprudence course at Business Academy, I was still unsure as to why a song me and a friend remixed was not taken down from any streaming platforms. Zigmars Liepiņš is a famous Latvian composer and author of the song we were remixing - 'Septītās Debesis'. We briefly exchanged emails regarding copyright with Zigmars, who then requested me to send over the final mix before publishing it. So I did, and in response to that, there was no response.\nTumbleweed Boring GIFfrom Tumbleweed GIFs \nThere was one disclosed point, though - we had to name the song something else than 'Septītās Debesis' if we were to register it. I didn't know what any of these big words meant at the time, so I named it 'Septītās Debesis', slapped it on DistroKid, closed my eyes, and prayed.\nHere's the song if you want to listen to it:\n\nI couldn't accept the fact it worked by pure accident, so I decided to dig deeper.\nUnderstanding Copyright\nCopyright protects your work automatically: Understanding how copyright works is crucial for creators. Here's a brief explanation:\n\nCopyright is a form of intellectual property protection that automatically applies to original works of authorship, including musical compositions, as soon as they are created and fixed in a tangible form.\nIt grants the creator exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, perform, display, and create derivative works based on the original creation.\nIn most countries, copyright protection lasts for the life of the author plus an additional 70 years after their death, also known as the life+70 rule. Fun fact: if there are multiple authors, it lasts for 70 years after the last author's death.\nWhile registration is not required for copyright protection, registering your work with the copyright office of your country can provide additional benefits, such as the ability to sue for infringement and potentially recover statutory damages and attorney's fees.\nIt's important to note that copyright protects the expression of ideas, not the ideas themselves. This means that while your specific melody and lyrics are protected, the general concept or theme of your song is not.\n\nTypes of Copyright Income\nThere are four main sources of copyright income you can generate as a musician:\n\nMechanical Royalties\nPublic Performance Royalties\nSynchronization Royalties\nOther/Ancillary Royalties\n\nLet's explore each of these in detail.\n1. Mechanical Royalties\nMechanical royalties are payments made for the reproduction and distribution of your music. It all dates back to 1897 when the American engineer E.S. Votey invented the first player piano - a piano that could play music by itself using paper rolls. Back then, the song was mechanically printed on these paper rolls, and that's where the term \"mechanical\" comes from.\n\nYears passed, and mechanical royalties turned into CD sales, vinyl records. Then, next comes - Spotify streams.\n\nToday, the most widespread mechanical royalties come from streaming services - Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, etc. But if you go to a store and buy a CD or a vinyl, that's still a mechanical royalty and it goes to the artist. Though, in this case, the store is most likely a retailer that already bought the CD from a record label or distributor, so the royalties were already paid. With streaming, it's a bit different.\nWhen a user listens to a song on Spotify, YouTube, or any other streaming service, the service pays the rights holders (that'd be the artist, record label, and sometimes publishers) a small fee per stream. The fee depends on the market, but on average it's about 0.005 USD per stream. If Spotify gets 1 million streams of your song, and you own the copyright, you will get 5000 USD.\nTo maximize your mechanical royalties, you can:\n\nConsider working with an independent record label to help distribute your music.\nEnsure your music is available on all major streaming platforms.\nKeep track of your streams and downloads to verify your royalty payments.\nMake good music. And more music.\n\nIf you've never gone through the process of releasing a song, you might have heard about platforms like DistroKid or TuneCore. Even if not - these are simply platforms that help you get your music on all the major streaming platforms, they're called music distributors.\nWhat's the difference between indepedent publishing and record label publishing?\nIndependent Publishing (e.g., DistroKid, TuneCore):\n\nYou retain full control over your music and rights\nHigher royalty rates (typically 80-100%)\nFlexibility to release music on your own schedule\nLower upfront costs\nYou're responsible for your own marketing and promotion\nYou handle administrative tasks yourself\n\nRecord Label Publishing:\n\nAccess to industry connections and professional support\nPotential for advances against future royalties\nLower royalty rates (often 10-50%)\nLess control over creative decisions and release schedules\nPotential for wider reach and audience\nMarketing and promotional support provided\n\nRecord labels sound like a better choice (and generally are a better choice), but it takes a certain level of skill to get into a label. Ultimately, the choice depends on your goals, resources, and career stage and your values. If a label doesn't represent your values, it might be better to stay independent. Many artists start with independent publishing and later transition to labels as their careers grow.\n2. Public Performance Royalties\nThese royalties are generated when your music is played in public spaces. In the Copyright law, a public performance is defined as:\n\nPlaces where people can freely enter and exit\nLarge gatherings that aren't just friends and family\nVenues where music is being transmitted or played through a device\n\nFew examples:\n\nA public performance is: a concert, a festival, a bar, a club, a restaurant, a hotel, etc. Also playing your favorite song on a speaker in your yard is a public performance.\nA public performance is not: a wedding, surprisingly.\n\nTo collect these royalties, you have to register with a Performing Rights Organization (PRO). As I'm based in Latvia, the PRO I would typically register with is AKKA/LAA. However, AKKA LAA has been criticized for its monopolistic practices and high tariffs for public performance royalties. The Latvian Competition Council has previously ruled that AKKA LAA abused its dominant position by charging excessive rates compared to similar organizations in neighboring countries like Estonia and Lithuania. source\nBe vary of PROs that don't have any competition. They can easily abuse their monopolistic status and charge extortionate rates. Thankfully, in EU, you can register with a PRO located in any country. But why there's still not a boycott against AKKA/LAA? Well, it only makes sense that songs in Latvian are registered with a Latvian PRO. You can think of it like a cultural vendor-lock. However, if you believe another PRO will better serve your interests and values, you're completely free to register with them instead.\nRemember, the PRO will handle licensing and royalty calculations on your behalf. (or at least they should (I'm looking at you AKKA/LAA ))\n3. Synchronization Royalties\nSync royalties come from the use of your music in visual media like films, TV shows, commercials, or video games.\nImagine epic 'Pirates of the Caribbean' theme song playing\nPirate Of Pirate Of The Carribean GIFfrom Pirate Of GIFs \nTo pursue sync opportunities:\n\nIf you're your own publisher, research films or shows that might be interested in your music.\nReach out to production companies or music supervisors.\nCarefully evaluate any offers you receive.\nNegotiate a deal, which could be a percentage of revenue or a flat fee.\n\nSynchronization royalties are notably the best way to make money from your music. It depends on the type of deal - if it's for a movie that's gonna to play in schools, it's probably going to be a small deal, but if it's for a movie that's going to play in cinemas, it's probably going to be a bigger deal. Take Hans Zimmer's Time from Inception - it's one of the most famous movie songs of all time, and it's still being played today.\nWhile you can aim for sync royalties with your music, that's a long process and not something you can rely on. It's more about making music that expresses your authentic self and putting it out there. If it resonates with people, sync placements will happen eventually. A way to increase your chances, though, is getting a publisher to help you with sync opportunities. Publisher is like your partner - it's in their best interest to hook you up with good deals. However, publishers, like record labels, are hard to get into, and they often have their own roster of artists.\n4. Other/Ancillary Royalties\nThis is where you let your mind roam - what other ways are there earn from your music? There are some generic ones:\n\nMerchandising Rights\n\nIf you sell merchandise featuring your brand or music (like T-shirts, posters, etc.), you can earn additional income. Profits from merchandise sales can be substantial, especially during tours or events where fans are eager to support you.\n\nLicensing for Covers\n\nIf other artists cover your songs, they need to obtain a mechanical license to do so, generating additional royalties for you as the original songwriter. Each cover version can generate mechanical royalties similar to those from original recordings.\n\nSheet music sales &amp; lyric displays\n\nBy utilizing a marketplace where you put your songs transcribed to sheet music, you can get some direct sales. As well as licensing your lyrics for use on lyric display websites or apps can go a long way. Lyric videos on their own perform very well btw.\n\nPatreon\n\nAlthough it's less to do with copyright, I think it's worth mentioning - Patreon is a platform that allows you to sell exclusive music to your fans. You can set the price, and the fan can pay you a monthly subscription to access your music. It's a great way to make money from your music, and you can even gamify it by giving your patrons access to exclusive content, like unreleased songs, behind-the-scenes looks, or even direct involvement in the creative process.\nI could really keep going. There are many platforms that allow you to push the boundaries as an artist. Another example would be a musical toothbrush - it requires copyright to the music, too. So if making toothbrush jingles for a living sounds like your type of thing to do, go for it, magic toothbrush man!\nMaximizing Your Copyright Income\nNow for a few takeaways from what was discussed - to make the most of your copyright:\n\nRegister as an artist with a PRO (Performance Rights Organization).\nConsider working with a music publisher to help manage your rights and find opportunities.\nContinue creating authentic, high-quality music to increase your chances of success.\nStay informed about the different types of royalties and actively pursue opportunities in each area.\n\nAside from copyright, I want to also talk about other crucial factors that can boost your music, since it still closely correlates with copyright. So, first and foremost - marketing. And again - MARKETING. You simply cannot overlook marketing entirely. Nobody will discover your music if you don't make it resonate with and audience. So here's a few extra tips:\n\n\nCreate quality content: Focus on producing the best music you can. Quality content is more likely to be shared and playlisted organically.\n\n\nUtilize Spotify for Artists: This free tool provides valuable insights and promotional opportunities. Use it to customize your profile, submit songs for playlist consideration, and understand your audience better.\n\n\nPromote on social media: Share your Spotify links on your social media platforms. Create engaging content around your music to encourage followers to stream your tracks.\n\n\nCollaborate with other artists: Collaborations can help you reach new audiences and potentially get featured on more playlists.\n\n\nEngage with your fans: Respond to comments, create special playlists for your fans, and keep them updated about new releases.\n\n\nSubmit to playlist curators: Research and submit your music to playlist curators who feature similar artists.\n\n\nNow, all of these tips I talked about in this blog so far sound great and can get you far, but there's just one thing, though - the game is rigged. We all already know that. If you didn't, well, here's some bad or good news for you, depending on how you approach the situation.\nSpotify phone farms\n\nTo understand what even is this you're seeing, you need to understand how Spotify algorithm works for counting song streams. A stream is counted:\n\nMultiple times for the same user, even if they listen to the song more than once.\nWhen a user listens to the song for at least 30 seconds.\nWhen the song is looped, the same rules apply.\n\nYou see where this is going? An album of 10 songs, each the length of 3min, can be streamed in just 15 minutes. The resulting amount of streams is not that impressive with just one user. However, if you have 1000 listeners, and each of them streams your album 10 times, you can get 10000 streams in just 15 minutes.\nThe benefits of a phone farm are obvious:\n\nYou get more streams, which means more royalties.\nYou get more exposure, which means more listeners, more fans, more people interested in your music.\n\nHave you ever stumbled upon a song on Spotify that's perfectly 1min long, cuts abruptly, and sounds like the most basic house music loop? Chances are it's a phone farm. To make it even more distopian - when you start listening to a 1min song, Spotify automatically puts you onto more 1min songs without you even noticing. Happened to me once, some of these songs are actually fire.\nWhy does it do that? Spotify algorithm is closed-source, unfortunately. I can only make an educated guess that it just so happens to have these 1min songs in rotation because they are very similar by their structure. OR because Spotify actually benefits from the phone farms - Spotify makes money from the advertisers putting ads on their platform. They get shown only to people who use Spotify free plan. The more people listen to music, the more money Spotify makes. The more money Spotify makes, the more money the advertisers make. It's a win-win-win situation.\nHow can you use it to your advantage?\nQuite simple, actually. A lot from what I've described previously:\n\nGather TONS of phones.\nEnsure each phone has a different IP address, and each running a different browser profile.\nHook up a bot that skips songs periodically right at the 30 second mark to maximize efficiency.\nPut the song/album on loop.\n\n...and you have a phone farm.\nIs it illegal? No. Is it unethical? Yes. Is it manipulative? Yes.\nThere are a few drawbacks, though:\n\nIt takes a lot of work to set up and maintain a phone farm.\nIt can be expensive to run, especially if you need a lot of phones.\nIt's not sustainable in the long run, as Spotify can eventually catch on and ban your accounts.\nIt's only beneficial if your goal is to make quick money from music in the short term. Let's be real, making 1min beats for the sake of algorithm is kinda sad.\n\nAnd to top it all off,\nExtra (not so ethical) ways to grow your Spotify audience\n\n\nBuy Plays: This is the most unethical way to grow your Spotify audience. It's also the fastest way to get your account banned.\n\n\nUse bots: Bots are programs that simulate human activity on Spotify. They can be used to like, follow, and comment on your music. While this can give you a boost in the short term, it's not sustainable and can damage your reputation.\n\n\nUse third-party apps: Some apps claim to help you grow your Spotify audience by mass following or liking other users. These apps can be a scam and can get your account banned.\n\n\nUse Spotify Playlist Curators: While this is not unethical, it is a bit manipulative. Playlist curators are people who select music for Spotify playlists. If you're not good enough to get on their own playlists, you shouldn't use them to grow your audience.\n\n\nConclusion\nMusic, in my opinion, is one of the most powerful forms of art. With all the copyright royalties and sketchy ways to make money from music, it should not get mutilated any longer. I encourage you to try everything, but don't get lost in the sauce, especially when it comes to music. I believe that after reading this blog you're already scheming something, thinking about the next money move. But I want you to remember - behind all the copyright nuisanse and large digital phone farms, there's still a person trying to express themselves and make a connection with people. Don't let the spark fade. Music has always been about that.\nHow to Make Money with Your Music Copyrights\nGenerative AI for Legal Services Primer\n","id":"https://notdevkey.github.io/copyright-money/","title":"Maximizing copyright for monetary gain"},"https://notdevkey.github.io/going-against-the-curve/":{"body":"Let's talk about something most people dread: economic recessions. Those doom-and-gloom periods when headlines scream about market crashes, unemployment spikes, and general economic misery. While the average investor runs for the hills during these times (often selling at the worst possible moment), the truly savvy ones are quietly positioning themselves to build generational wealth.\n\nThat's right - I'm going to show you how economic downturns can actually be prime opportunities for building wealth, if you know what you're doing. I call this \"going against the curve,\" and it's the investing strategy that has created more millionaires than any bull market ever could.\nThe Psychology of Recession Investing\nBefore diving into specific investment approaches, we need to address the elephant in the room: fear. When markets crash, our primitive brains kick into survival mode. We panic. We make emotional decisions. This is precisely why Warren Buffett's famous quote becomes so relevant:\n\n\"Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.\"\n\n\nThis isn't just clever wordplay - it's the fundamental principle behind contrarian investing. When everyone is selling in panic, prices get artificially depressed, creating buying opportunities that simply don't exist during bull markets.\nEconomic Indicators: Your Recession Early Warning System\nBefore you can profit from a recession, you need to know one is coming. Here are the indicators the pros watch:\nLeading Economic Index (LEI)\nThe Conference Board's Leading Economic Index is a composite of ten forward-looking indicators designed to predict economic activity. When the LEI has fallen for several consecutive months, particularly if the six-month rate of decline falls below -4.3%, recession warning bells should be ringing in your head. The LEI typically peaks about 11-12 months before a recession begins, giving you ample time to position your portfolio.\nThe LEI comprises ten components that collectively signal future economic conditions1:\n\nAverage weekly hours in manufacturing\nAverage weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance\nManufacturers' new orders for consumer goods and materials\nISM® Index of New Orders\nManufacturers' new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft orders\nBuilding permits for new private housing units\nS&amp;P 500® Index of Stock Prices\nLeading Credit Index™\nInterest rate spread (10-year Treasury bonds less federal funds rate)\nAverage consumer expectations for business conditions\n\nAccording to The Conference Board's research, the LEI has correctly predicted every U.S. recession since the 1960s, typically with a lead time of 7-12 months before the economic downturn begins2.\n\nInverted Yield Curve\nThis is the big one. An inverted yield curve occurs when short-term government bonds yield more than long-term bonds - essentially signaling that investors have more confidence in the short-term economy than the long-term. Historically, when the 10-year Treasury yield falls below the 2-year yield, a recession has followed within 6-24 months with remarkable consistency.\nThe beauty of the inverted yield curve is its reliability. Since the 1950s, it has predicted virtually every recession with very few false signals - making it the economic equivalent of seeing dark clouds before a storm.\nA 2018 research paper by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco found that the inverted yield curve has preceded all nine U.S. recessions since 1955, with only one false signal in the mid-1960s3. The median time between the initial inversion and the start of a recession was about 12 months.\n\nOECD Composite Leading Indicator (CLI)\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) publishes its own composite leading indicator, designed to provide early signals of turning points in business cycles. The CLI is constructed to identify economic fluctuations relative to long-term trends, with readings below 100 suggesting below-trend growth ahead.\nThe OECD CLI has successfully predicted all major global economic downturns since the 1970s, with an average lead time of 6-9 months4. What makes the CLI particularly valuable is its international scope, covering 33 OECD member countries plus 6 major non-member economies like China and India.\nChicago Fed National Activity Index (CFNAI)\nThe CFNAI is a monthly index designed to gauge overall economic activity and related inflationary pressure. It's a weighted average of 85 existing monthly indicators of national economic activity, making it broader than many other indices.\nResearch from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago has shown that when the three-month moving average of the CFNAI falls below -0.7 following a period of economic expansion, there is an increased likelihood that a recession has begun5. This indicator is particularly useful because it incorporates data from four broad categories:\n\nProduction and income\nEmployment, unemployment, and hours\nPersonal consumption and housing\nSales, orders, and inventories\n\nPurchasing Managers' Index (PMI)\nThe PMI is a monthly survey of private sector companies that provides information about current and future business conditions. Published by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), the PMI is one of the most closely watched indicators of manufacturing activity.\nA PMI reading below 50 indicates contraction in the manufacturing sector, while readings above 50 signal expansion. Research has shown that when the manufacturing PMI falls below 45 for two consecutive months, a broader economic recession often follows within 3-6 months6.\n\nOther Indicators Worth Monitoring\n\nInitial Jobless Claims: A sudden sustained rise in weekly unemployment claims often precedes economic contractions\nConsumer Sentiment: Measured by the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, sharp declines often precede reduced consumer spending\nCorporate Profit Margins: Compression in profit margins frequently leads to reduced business investment and hiring\nCredit Spreads: Widening spreads between corporate bonds and Treasury securities signal increasing market stress\n\nThe Four Investment Kingdoms: Where to Put Your Money\nNow let's talk about the four major asset classes and how they typically perform during recessions.\n1. Real Estate: The Concrete Gold Mine\n\nReal estate typically experiences significant price drops during recessions, creating exceptional buying opportunities. Consider these strategies:\nPros during recession:\n\nDistressed properties become available at substantial discounts\nLower interest rates (central banks cut rates to stimulate economy) mean cheaper financing\nReduced competition from other buyers\nCash flow opportunities from rental properties\n\nCons during recession:\n\nProperty values may continue declining after purchase\nTenant defaults and vacancies can increase\nFinancing might be harder to obtain despite lower rates\nProperty maintenance costs remain regardless of income\n\nRecession strategy:\nLook for properties in stable neighborhoods with strong rental demand. Focus on cash flow rather than appreciation potential. Be extremely selective and maintain a significant cash buffer for unexpected expenses. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) focusing on necessity-based commercial properties (grocery-anchored shopping centers, medical offices) can be excellent alternatives to direct ownership.\nAccording to research from the National Bureau of Economic Research, residential real estate prices declined by an average of 19.7% during the past three major U.S. recessions, creating significant buying opportunities for well-positioned investors7.\nI once met a real estate investor who built a portfolio of 15 rental properties during the 2008-2012 housing crash. He followed a simple rule: each property needed to generate at least 12% cash-on-cash return based on recession-level rents. By 2020, his portfolio had tripled in value while providing consistent income throughout the ownership period.\n2. Commodities: Hard Assets for Hard Times\n\nCommodities perform uniquely during economic contractions, with significant variation between different types.\nPros during recession:\n\nGold often serves as a safe haven during financial turmoil\nAgricultural commodities remain necessary regardless of economic conditions\nEnergy commodities eventually rebound as economic activity recovers\nCan provide portfolio diversification when stocks and bonds struggle\n\nCons during recession:\n\nIndustrial commodities (copper, steel) can crash as manufacturing contracts\nStorage and holding costs for physical commodities\nHigh volatility and potential liquidity issues\nNo income generation capability (unlike stocks or bonds)\n\nRecession strategy:\nFocus on gold and consumer staple agricultural commodities. Consider using ETFs rather than futures contracts to avoid complexity and leverage risks. Gradually accumulate industrial commodities as the recession deepens, positioning for the eventual recovery.\nResearch from the World Gold Council shows that gold has delivered positive returns during 7 of the 8 recessions since 1970, with an average performance of +10.8% when equity markets declined8.\nDuring the 2020 COVID crash, gold initially fell alongside stocks but quickly rebounded and gained over 30% that year. Meanwhile, oil prices briefly went negative (an unprecedented event), demonstrating how different commodities can behave during crisis periods.\n3. Stocks: Buying Businesses on Sale\n\nStock markets typically experience significant declines during recessions, with the S&amp;P 500 falling 20-40% in modern recessions. However, this creates exceptional opportunities.\nPros during recession:\n\nQuality companies trade at deep discounts to intrinsic value\nDividend yields increase as prices fall\nOnce-in-a-decade opportunities in certain sectors\nAbility to accumulate positions in growing industries\n\nCons during recession:\n\nPainful paper losses if buying too early\nDividend cuts from struggling companies\nPotential bankruptcy of overleveraged businesses\nPsychological difficulty buying when headlines are most negative\n\nRecession strategy:\nFocus on companies with strong balance sheets (low debt), stable cash flows, and essential products/services. Consumer staples (Procter &amp; Gamble, Coca-Cola), healthcare (Johnson &amp; Johnson), utilities, and discount retailers (Walmart) typically outperform during recessions.\nA study by J.P. Morgan Asset Management found that five of the S&amp;P 500's best 10 trading days in each decade occurred within two weeks of the 10 worst days9. This highlights why staying invested (or even better, adding to positions) during market panics is crucial for long-term returns.\nIf you're more aggressive, consider carefully selected companies in cyclical industries after significant price declines. In March 2020, for example, many quality bank stocks traded at 50% of book value, subsequently doubling or tripling when economic fears subsided.\n4. Fixed Income: Bonds and Beyond\n\nThe fourth investment kingdom - bonds and fixed income - plays a crucial role during economic contractions.\nPros during recession:\n\nGovernment bonds typically appreciate as interest rates fall\nProvide income during uncertain times\nHigh-quality corporate bonds eventually offer attractive yields\nServe as portfolio stabilizers\n\nCons during recession:\n\nHigh-yield (junk) bonds can crash alongside stocks\nDefault risk increases for corporate issuers\nInflation risk if central banks implement aggressive monetary stimulus\nOpportunity cost if bought too early in the cycle\n\nRecession strategy:\nMaintain a ladder of high-quality government and investment-grade corporate bonds. As the recession deepens, gradually increase allocation to higher-yielding corporate bonds from financially solid companies. Consider Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) to hedge against potential inflation from stimulus measures.\nResearch from PIMCO has shown that U.S. Treasury bonds delivered positive returns in all eight recession periods since 1973, with an average return of 8.1% during these economic contractions10.\nDuring the 2008 financial crisis, U.S. Treasury bonds gained over 20% while stocks crashed 50%. Later in the crisis, certain investment-grade corporate bonds offered yields exceeding 8% with minimal default risk - essentially allowing fixed-income investors to \"lock in\" equity-like returns with significantly less risk.\nShorting the Crisis: Advanced Strategies\n\nFor investors with higher risk tolerance and experience, economic crises present unique shorting opportunities. Here are some approaches to consider, though proceed with extreme caution:\nIdentifying Vulnerable Sectors\nDuring the early stages of recession, focus on:\n\nLuxury goods manufacturers and retailers\nCompanies with high debt loads and poor cash flow\nCyclical industries heavily dependent on discretionary spending\nFinancial institutions with exposure to deteriorating asset classes\n\nFor example, in 2007-2008, homebuilders, mortgage lenders, and financial companies with subprime exposure experienced catastrophic declines. In 2020, cruise lines, airlines, and hotel chains saw similar collapses.\nShorting Methods\nThere are several ways to implement short positions:\n\nInverse ETFs: These funds are designed to move opposite to their target index or sector\nPut options: Provide leveraged exposure to downside moves with defined risk\nShort selling individual stocks: Only for experienced investors due to unlimited theoretical risk\nCredit default swaps: Complex derivatives that increase in value as credit quality deteriorates\n\nA study by the Financial Analysts Journal found that adding a modest allocation (5-10%) to managed short positions during recessions improved risk-adjusted portfolio returns over full market cycles11.\nThe most famous example of crisis shorting was Michael Burry (portrayed in \"The Big Short\"), who made billions betting against subprime mortgage bonds. As he explained in his post-crisis interviews:\n\n\"I started getting bearish on the subprime market in 2003, when I saw the first no-money-down mortgages being marketed... It took years before the market realized what was happening.\"\n\nA Word of Caution\nShorting requires excellent timing, strong risk management, and emotional discipline. Even the most obvious short candidates can experience dramatic short-term rallies that can wipe out poorly timed positions. Use small position sizes and strict risk controls if pursuing this strategy.\nSpecific Examples: Crisis Investing Opportunities\nLet me share some specific examples of contrarian investments that delivered exceptional returns during past recessions:\n2008-2009 Financial Crisis\n\nAmerican Express (AXP): Fell from $60 to $10 on fears of credit card defaults. Warren Buffett doubled his position. By 2013, it had recovered to $80.\nLas Vegas Sands (LVS): Crashed from $140 to $1.50 on bankruptcy fears. Rebounded to $50+ within three years.\nApple (AAPL): Dropped to $12 (split-adjusted) during market panic. Would be worth over $3,000 today with dividends reinvested.\n\n2020 COVID Crisis\n\nCarnival Cruise (CCL): Plunged from $50 to $8. Rebounded to $30 within a year.\nBank of America (BAC): Fell from $35 to $18. Recovered to $40+ as economic fears subsided.\nDisney (DIS): Dropped from $150 to $85 as parks closed. Reached new all-time highs within 12 months.\n\nThe key pattern? Quality companies in temporarily distressed industries offer the greatest upside potential during crisis periods.\nBuilding Your Recession Playbook\n\nHere's how to create your personal recession investment strategy:\n\n\nPreparation Phase (When yield curve inverts):\n\nBuild cash reserves (aim for 20-30% of portfolio)\nCreate a shopping list of quality assets to buy during the downturn\nReduce exposure to highly cyclical industries\nConsider adding small hedge positions\n\n\n\nEarly Recession Phase (Economic data deteriorating):\n\nBegin deploying cash gradually into highest-quality assets\nFocus on dividend aristocrats and consumer staples\nIncrease bond allocation, especially government bonds\nMaintain discipline while others panic\n\n\n\nDeep Recession Phase (Maximum pessimism):\n\nDeploy capital more aggressively\nLook for opportunities in distressed sectors\nBegin positioning for eventual recovery\nRemember Buffett's wisdom about being greedy when others are fearful\n\n\n\nRecovery Positioning (Economic indicators bottoming):\n\nShift toward more cyclical industries\nReduce bond allocation in favor of equities\nConsider small positions in the most beaten-down sectors\nBe patient - recoveries often take longer than expected\n\n\n\nAs Howard Marks writes in his book \"Mastering the Market Cycle\":\n\n\"The most dangerous words in investing are 'this time it's different.' Every crisis feels unique when you're in it. But the pattern of excessive optimism followed by excessive pessimism has repeated throughout market history.\"\n\nFinal Thoughts\nEconomic recessions are inevitable parts of the business cycle. Rather than fearing them, sophisticated investors understand they create the richest opportunities for those with preparation, capital, and emotional discipline.\nRemember that the greatest fortunes aren't made by following the crowd. They're made by having the courage to go against it - by buying quality assets when everyone else is selling them, and by maintaining a long-term perspective when others are trapped in short-term panic.\nSo the next time you see headlines about economic doom, remember this blog post. That may just be your signal to begin deploying capital while whispering to yourself: \"It's time to go against the curve.\"\n\n1\nThe Conference Board, \"US Leading Indicators,\" https://www.conference-board.org/topics/us-leading-indicators\n2: The Conference Board, \"Leading Economic Indicators and the Oncoming Recession,\" December 2022\n3: Michael D.

As organizations face unprecedented challenges—from global pandemics to technological disruption—the qualities that define great leadership are evolving. That's precisely why our team embarked on an ambitious project: interviewing dozens of successful leaders across diverse industries to uncover the essential characteristics that will define the leaders of tomorrow.\n\nOur \"Future Leadership\" course brought us face-to-face with CEOs, entrepreneurs, nonprofit directors, and public sector leaders—all generously sharing their hard-earned wisdom. While each leader had unique perspectives shaped by their experiences, several clear patterns emerged that transcend industry boundaries. These insights have formed the foundation of what we now understand as the essential framework for future-ready leadership.\n1. Becoming a People's Person: The Heart of Leadership\nThe most striking pattern we discovered was how universally successful leaders prioritize genuine human connection. In a world increasingly dominated by digital communication and artificial intelligence, the distinctly human ability to connect emotionally with others stands out as a competitive advantage.\n\nOne tech company leader we interviewed put it concisely: \"All the technical expertise in the world can't compensate for an inability to understand, motivate, and truly care about your people.\"\nBeing people-centered involves three critical components:\nAuthentic Presence\nFuture leaders understand that being physically present isn't enough—they must be emotionally and mentally present as well. This means putting away devices during conversations, maintaining eye contact, and demonstrating through body language that the person speaking has your full attention.\nResearch published in the Journal of Organizational Behavior shows that leaders who practice presence—fully engaging in the moment—inspire 34% higher levels of team commitment than those perceived as distracted or disengaged1.\nActive Listening\nWe observed that exceptional leaders spend far more time listening than talking. They ask thoughtful questions, seek to understand different perspectives, and avoid interrupting others or formulating responses while someone else is speaking.\nAccording to Dr. Elizabeth Gordon, leadership researcher at Stanford University: \"Active listening is not passive—it's one of the most dynamic and influential tools in a leader's toolkit. When people feel truly heard, their trust, creativity, and commitment significantly increase.\"\nGenuine Care\nPerhaps most importantly, future-ready leaders demonstrate authentic concern for their team members as whole people, not just as organizational resources. They remember personal details, acknowledge important life events, and make time to understand individual aspirations and challenges.\nRecent research from the Center for Creative Leadership confirms this approach, finding that leaders who demonstrate genuine empathy experience 26% less team turnover and 21% higher productivity compared to those perceived as uncaring2.\n2. Communication Skills: The Leadership Superpower\nNearly every leader we interviewed emphasized communication as the single most important skill set they've developed throughout their careers. The ability to articulate ideas clearly, listen effectively, and adapt communication styles to different audiences emerged as a universal requirement for effective leadership.\n\nClear and Concise Messaging\nFuture leaders understand the importance of distilling complex ideas into simple, memorable concepts that inspire action. They recognize that confusion leads to inaction, while clarity drives progress.\nThe ability to communicate complex situations in straightforward terms is what separates great leaders from merely good ones.\nAdapting Communication Style\nOur research revealed that versatile communicators who can adjust their style to match different audiences are particularly effective. This includes adapting to various:\n\nPersonality types (analytical vs. emotional communicators)\nCultural backgrounds and norms\nLearning preferences (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)\nGenerational differences\nProfessional backgrounds\n\nHarvard Business School research suggests that leaders who can adapt their communication style to different audiences are rated 42% more effective by their teams than those who maintain a single approach regardless of context3.\nMastering Digital Communication\nToday's leaders must be adept at communicating effectively across multiple channels—from in-person conversations to video calls, emails, messaging apps, and social platforms. Understanding the strengths and limitations of each medium has become essential.\n\"The best communicators understand which channel suits which message,\" observed a tech industry leader. \"Sensitive feedback requires face-to-face conversation, while quick updates might be perfect for Slack. The medium is part of the message.\"\n3. Process Expertise: Understanding the Machinery of Success\nThe leaders we interviewed consistently emphasized that effective leadership requires a thorough understanding of the processes that drive results in their particular field. Surface-level knowledge isn't sufficient—future leaders need deep comprehension of how various components interconnect to create successful outcomes.\n\nThe Value of Domain Knowledge\nWhile some leadership principles are universal, our interviews revealed that the best leaders combine general leadership skills with deep domain expertise. They've typically spent time \"in the trenches\" and understand the day-to-day realities of their industry.\nA port logistics executive explained: \"I can't effectively lead our production teams if I don't understand how the ships come and go, what every tool does and when to utilize the right tools for efficiency, and when to avoid them. My credibility and ability to make informed decisions depend on knowing how the entire system works.\"\nSystems Thinking\nFuture leaders demonstrate the ability to see both the forest and the trees. They understand how individual processes connect to form larger systems and can anticipate how changes to one area might impact others.\nResearch from MIT's Sloan School of Management indicates that leaders with strong systems thinking skills make more effective strategic decisions and generate 27% better business outcomes than those who take a more fragmented approach4.\nContinuous Learning\nGiven the accelerating pace of change across industries, successful leaders commit to ongoing learning about evolving processes and technologies. They recognize that yesterday's expertise may not apply to tomorrow's challenges.\n4. Conflict Prevention: The Art of Anticipation\nPerhaps the most sophisticated leadership skill we identified was the ability to prevent conflicts before they emerge. Unlike reactive conflict resolution, which addresses problems after they surface, conflict prevention requires a proactive mindset and exceptional interpersonal awareness.\n\nCreating Psychological Safety\nLeaders skilled at conflict prevention establish environments where team members feel safe expressing concerns early—before they escalate into larger issues. They create cultures where disagreement is viewed as valuable rather than threatening.\nGoogle's Project Aristotle research identified psychological safety as the single most important factor in effective teams, with psychologically safe environments experiencing 41% fewer interpersonal conflicts5.\nClarifying Expectations\nMany conflicts stem from misaligned expectations. Future-ready leaders invest time upfront to ensure team members share a common understanding of:\n\nGoals and objectives\nRoles and responsibilities\nDecision-making authority\nCommunication protocols\nPerformance standards\n\n\"The clearer the expectations, the fewer the misunderstandings,\" observed a nonprofit executive. \"Most conflicts I've witnessed stem from people having different mental models of what success looks like.\"\nReading Emotional Undercurrents\nExceptional leaders develop a sixth sense for detecting emotional tensions before they manifest as open conflicts. They notice subtle changes in behavior, communication patterns, or team dynamics that signal potential issues.\n\"By the time someone directly complains, the conflict has usually been brewing for weeks,\" explained the head redactor of a local newspaper. \"The art is noticing the early warning signs—decreased engagement, subtle changes in tone, or avoidance behaviors—and addressing the underlying issues before they escalate.\" She'd rather sit in the same room as her team than the room that's supposed to be the head redactor's office with a big table and a nice view out of the window - that way she feels a conflict brewing as she literally feels the air changing.\nResearch from the Harvard Negotiation Project shows that addressing potential conflicts at their earliest stages results in 78% faster resolution and 92% lower emotional costs to team relationships6.\n5. Building a Trustworthy Team: The Leadership Multiplier\nThe final essential quality we identified was the ability to select, develop, and retain the right team members. Future leaders understand that their effectiveness is ultimately determined by the quality of the people around them and the trust they establish within those relationships.\n\nTalent Selection\nExceptional leaders develop sophisticated approaches to identifying talent that goes beyond technical skills to assess cultural fit, growth potential, emotional intelligence, and intrinsic motivation.\n\"I've learned to hire more for character, curiosity, and compatibility than for credentials,\" shared one successful entrepreneur. \"Technical skills can be taught, but core values and drive come from within.\"\nTrust Building\nOnce the right team is assembled, effective leaders systematically build trust through:\n\nMaintaining confidentiality\nFollowing through on commitments\nShowing vulnerability when appropriate\nProviding both support and accountability\nAcknowledging mistakes\nGiving credit generously\nMaking expectations explicit\n\nResearch from the Trust Research Institute indicates that high-trust organizations are 2.5 times more productive and experience 74% less stress than low-trust environments7.\nTeam Development\nFinally, future-ready leaders invest significantly in developing their teams' capabilities, creating growth opportunities that align individual aspirations with organizational needs.\nAdditional Emerging Leadership Qualities\nBeyond the five core qualities we've explored, our research identified several additional characteristics that appear increasingly important for future leaders:\nAdaptability\nAs change accelerates across industries, leaders must demonstrate exceptional adaptability—quickly adjusting strategies, processes, and mindsets to address emerging challenges and opportunities.\nDigital Fluency\nWhile technical expertise can be delegated, future leaders need sufficient digital fluency to understand how technology impacts their business models, customer experiences, and operational processes.\nGlobal Mindset\nEven leaders of regional organizations increasingly operate in a global context, requiring cultural sensitivity, awareness of international trends, and the ability to leverage diverse perspectives.\nEthical Intelligence\nAs organizations face complex ethical questions around technology use, environmental impact, and social responsibility, leaders must develop sophisticated approaches to navigating moral ambiguities.\nResilience\nPerhaps most importantly, tomorrow's leaders must demonstrate extraordinary resilience—maintaining physical, mental, and emotional well-being while guiding others through increasingly turbulent environments.\nThe LEAD Framework: A Practical Approach to Leadership Development\nBased on our extensive research and interviews, I've developed a practical framework anyone can implement to strengthen their leadership capabilities. I call this the LEAD approach:\n\nListen &amp; Learn (3 months)\nObjective: Develop deep understanding of yourself, your team, and your operating environment.\nKey Activities:\n\nComplete honest self-assessment of strengths and weaknesses\nConduct one-on-one conversations with each team member focused on understanding their perspectives, aspirations, and concerns\nIdentify 2-3 mentors from different backgrounds who can provide diverse perspectives\nEstablish regular learning practices (reading, courses, mastermind groups)\n\nSuccess Indicators:\n\nComprehensive personal development plan created\nDocumentation of team members' goals, preferences, and communication styles\nRegular mentorship meetings established\nLearning system implemented\n\nEngage &amp; Establish (3 months)\nObjective: Build relationships and create enabling systems for effective leadership.\nKey Activities:\n\nEstablish or clarify team operating norms and communication protocols\nCreate psychological safety through facilitated team discussions\nDevelop clear decision-making frameworks\nBuild relationships across organizational boundaries\nPractice and solicit feedback on communication effectiveness\n\nSuccess Indicators:\n\nTeam charter or operating agreements documented\nDecision rights clearly established\nCross-functional relationships mapped and strengthened\nCommunication effectiveness scores from team\n\nAct &amp; Adapt (3-6 months)\nObjective: Implement leadership practices while continuously refining approach based on feedback.\nKey Activities:\n\nSet ambitious but achievable team goals aligned with organizational priorities\nEstablish regular feedback mechanisms (surveys, one-on-ones, team retrospectives)\nCreate deliberate conflict prevention protocols\nBegin coaching and developing others\nPractice emotional regulation and resilience during challenges\n\nSuccess Indicators:\n\nTeam performance metrics improving\nReduced conflict and faster conflict resolution\nIncreased team engagement scores\nPersonal resilience measures maintaining or improving\n\nDevelop &amp; Deepen (6+ months)\nObjective: Strengthen leadership capabilities and cultivate next generation of leaders.\nKey Activities:\n\nIdentify succession options for key roles\nDelegate increasingly significant responsibilities\nEstablish peer coaching within the team\nSeek opportunities for strategic contribution beyond immediate team\nCreate structured development plans for high-potential team members\n\nSuccess Indicators:\n\nClear succession plans established\nTeam members taking on expanded responsibilities\nPeer coaching relationships formalized\nStrategic influence extending beyond immediate team\nNext-generation leaders emerging\n\nConclusion: Leadership as a Journey, Not a Destination\nOur exploration of future leadership has reinforced a fundamental truth: effective leadership is not a static achievement but an ongoing process of growth, adaptation, and renewal. The leaders who will thrive in tomorrow's complex environment are those who embrace continuous development—for themselves and their teams.\nAs one particularly insightful executive shared with us: \"Leadership isn't about reaching a particular level of authority—it's about becoming the type of person others genuinely want to follow. That journey never ends.\"\nBy focusing on becoming truly people-centered, mastering communication, understanding processes deeply, preventing conflicts proactively, and building trustworthy teams, you can develop the foundation for effective leadership in any context. The LEAD framework provides a structured approach to begin or accelerate that journey.\n1\nJournal of Organizational Behavior, \"Leadership Presence and Organizational Commitment: A Longitudinal Study,\" 2023\n2: Center for Creative Leadership, \"Empathy in Leadership: Impact on Retention and Performance,\" 2022\n3: Harvard Business School, \"Communication Adaptation and Leadership Effectiveness: A Five-Year Study,\" 2021\n4: MIT Sloan School of Management, \"Systems Thinking and Strategic Leadership Outcomes,\" 2022\n5: Google Project Aristotle, \"Psychological Safety and Team Performance,\" 2020\n6: Harvard Negotiation Project, \"Early Intervention in Organizational Conflicts,\" 2023\n7: Trust Research Institute, \"The Economics of Trust in High-Performance Organizations,\" 2024\n\nHigh Stakes Leadership: Leading in Times of Crisis\n","id":"https://notdevkey.github.io/leader-framework/","title":"Future Leadership: Essential Skills for the Leaders of Tomorrow"},"https://notdevkey.github.io/managing-affiliate-finances/":{"body":"\"Everything is based on money for money.\" That's how our Finance Management course at Business Academy started, and it couldn't be more true for affiliate marketing. While most affiliate guides focus on traffic and conversions, they rarely mention the complex financial infrastructure needed to make it all work. Here's how we turned our casino affiliate project from a simple spreadsheet into a scalable financial system.\n\n\nCash Fortress Snipers Eye GIFfrom Cash GIFs \n\n\"The highest form of wealth is the ability to wake up every morning and say 'I can do whatever I want today.'\" \n— Morgan Housel, The Psychology of Money\n\nThis quote resonated deeply with our approach to financial management. While building our affiliate business, we realized that true financial success isn't just about maximizing revenue - it's about creating systems that give you the freedom to grow sustainably.\nThe Financial Reality of Affiliate Business\nRunning an affiliate business like mansbonuss.com isn't just about placing links and watching commissions roll in. It's about building financial systems that can handle growth. Our journey taught us that success requires balancing four key elements:\n\nInitial Investment: Website development, content creation, and marketing\nOperational Costs: Hosting, tools, and team members\nRevenue Tracking: Commission structures and payment cycles\nScaling Costs: Recruitment and expansion expenses\n\nBuilding a Financial Framework\nThe Cashflow Sheet Evolution\nWhat started as a simple Excel spreadsheet quickly evolved into a comprehensive financial tracking system. Our cashflow sheet tracks:\n\n\nRevenue Streams:\n\nCasino affiliate commissions (ranging from 25% to 45% revenue share)\nCPA deals (€20-€100 per qualified player)\nSpecial promotion bonuses (up to €1000 for high-volume months)\nSub-affiliate revenue splits (70-30 in favor of recruiters)\n\n\n\nOperational Expenses:\n\nWebsite hosting (€0/month on Vercel)\nDiscord bot hosting (€0/month on fly.io)\nMarketing expenses (€100/month, primarily TikTok ads)\nTeam member compensation (commission-based)\nTournament bonuses (€500-1000 for top performers, 6x per year)\nDomain (mansbonuss.com €20/year, mansbonuss.lv €12/year)\n\n\n\n\nWe also made a sheet to track all the casino deals we have. Since there are multiple affiliate dashboards we need to track, it's easier to have a single source of truth:\n\nDetailed view available here.\nThe Discord Strategy\nOur Discord server became the central hub of our operation, serving multiple purposes:\nCommunity Building:\n\nSeparate channels for each casino partner\nExclusive deals and promotions\nReal-time support and updates\nSuccess story showcases\n\n\nWe hit 142 Discord members in 2 weeks. Before this sounds too exciting - the server initially had 130 members, but the 80% of the 12 were the ones who converted through physical poster, and the rest came through a Google Form with a link that displays after filling out the form.\nAffiliate Management:\n\nIndividual tracking links per affiliate\nAutomated commission reporting\nPerformance leaderboards\nTraining resources\n\nCustom Bot Features:\n\nTutorial distribution on demand\nCommission calculation assistance\nAutomated welcome messages\nLink verification system\n\n\nOur Growth Journey\nPhase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)\n\nSet up basic website with first casino partnerships\nCreated initial Discord server structure\nEstablished commission tracking system\nDeveloped basic tutorial content\n\nPhase 2: Optimization (Current)\n\nImproved website UI based on user feedback\nEnhanced Discord bot functionality\nStreamlined affiliate onboarding process\nCreated detailed performance metrics\n\nPhase 3: Scaling (Weeks 5-6)\n\nImplementing recruiter program\nExpanding casino partnerships\nDeveloping automated systems\nBuilding training resources\n\nFinancial Strategies That Worked\n1. The Hybrid Commission Model\nInstead of choosing between CPA and Revenue Share, we:\n\nStart affiliates with CPA for immediate rewards\nTransition to revenue share for long-term growth\nOffer hybrid options for risk management\nProvide performance-based bonuses\n\n2. Recruiter Incentive Structure\nOur recruiter program is built on:\n\nBase commission (€15 flat per conversion)\nPerformance bonuses for hitting targets\nTraining completion rewards\nLong-term retention incentives\n\n3. Cashflow Management\nWe implemented a strict financial discipline:\n\n40% reinvestment in growth\n30% operational reserve\n20% team compensation\n10% emergency fund\n\nTechnology Investment Strategy\nOur tech stack evolved based on needs:\n1. Website Platform\n\nBuilt on Next.js for speed and simplicity\nMobile-first design\nSEO-optimized structure\n\n2. Discord Integration\n\nCustom bot development in Typescript\nAutomated reporting system\nSeamless navigation through casino bonuses\nCommission tracking integration\n\n3.

I'm going to talk about all the insights, issues and how we resolved them. Also featuring some really crucial tips and an Ableton rack.\n\n\nThis is a blog where I go in detail about my experience and insights about the project and our solution. If you want to skip all the yapping, here's the TOC:\n\nContext\nJune\nJuly\nAugust\n\nAbleton Rack\nThe Sketch\nThe 3D model\nThe Web design\n\n\nSeptember\nOctober\n\nMIDI controller schema\nThe result\n\n\nNovember\nConclusion\n\nContext\nMay is coming to an end, I'm on a barbecue cookout, vibing with a couple of my friends, when the main barbecue guy - Davis - mentions that his sister is a representative from one of the collaborating parties in an upcoming innovation grants project called \"MaKE IT\". That immediately caught my attention.\nAlthough Davis didn't seem too keen on the idea at first, I did. I've participated in another innovation grants project before and had good overall memories, although we didn't get as far as we had expected. But, since then, it's always been a dream of mine to participate and lead my own team to victory in such project. So we made a team of 3 people - me, Davis and Aļika - and started brainstorming.\nThe project was supposed to last 4 months, but y'know how it is with time management - just add an extra 2 on top, that would make for a more precise estimate. This both was a handicap and an opportunity for miracles to happen, so here's how it all went.\nJune\nWe gathered for our first meeting to discuss potential ideas only to realize we've jumped into this without thinking of anything beforehand and not a single idea seemed to work. Our first idea wasn't even close to a MIDI controller - it was a smart plug that allows the tracking of electricity consumption and turn off the plug whenever a person isn't close and/or the consumption is too high. Crazy what you can come up with when you don't know your range.\nNothing much else happened in June, besides the fact we might've come up with a genius marketing strategy I'm not willing to explain.\n\nJuly\nThis is what we did repeatedly for 90% percent of July:\n\n\nThen we decided to gather on-site one more time to discuss other potential ideas. During the meetup we realized that we all have interest in music, me and Davis both even have experience in music production - that's when everyone started to open up and the big ideas started rolling in.\nAugust\nThis is when the path seemed clearer than ever. We had figured the base idea, done the research... but now what? The MIDI controller solution involves electronics and creating the schema, product 3D design, web design, marketing strategy and campaign. Our team doesn't even come close to completing all this, we just lacked the skills for that. Technically, I could've pooped out some simple solution for each of these points, but we're going for the big leagues, the chances of this working out would've been slim.\n\nRight from the beginning of the MIDI controller idea, I had this Fox Stevenson unreleased song in my head, especially the arpeggiated melody that starts at 0:00 and fades to the background at 0:10 in that video.\nFor a while I've been trying to replicate the feel of that melody, but without any success. What I noticed, though - there's lots of notes in the arpeggio and lots of added effects that create this beautiful soundscape. I could only approximate the approach that was used there:\n\nA modified sawtooth synth;\nSome arpeggiator plugin. I believe a plugin was used to arpeggiate the notes of a chord instead of drawing the arp notes manually since that's quite a lot of manual work;\nGrain delay plugin;\nReverb plugin.\n\nThis is the base of the sound which I believe is mostly correct. Reverse-engineering this wasn't that hard, but replicating the sound itself would be difficult, since the complicated chords. It would be perfect if there were known intervals between the notes in the chord, so that these chords could be generated instead of having to break your fingers trying to play big chords across the whole MIDI keyboard.\nThankfully, this is very achievable with the help of tonal harmonies. Tonal harmonies exist in every single song we hear every day - I dunno what else to explain. Essentially, tonal harmonies serve as a guide for which note goes well together with another note. By looking at the theory behind it, there are noticeable intervals between every note in any chord, with the condition that the chord sounds right. Welp, there's always jazz fuckers who will find the resolution chord even for the sound the piano makes when you sit on it and call it the C7(#9(5€)#11b13). I won't be looking into this. However, I want to find the sweet spot for generating these dreamy chords, while also not restraining the user to only those intervals - that would be a shame.\nAbleton Rack\n\nDownload for Ableton\nI made this Ableton rack by combining an existing chord generator rack I customized with my own extension of the rack with added effects. The goal of this was to simulate the result I wanted to achieve with the MIDI controller as close as I imagined it in my head. Just download it, throw it onto an Ableton MIDI track and play some notes while tweaking the knobs. It's still missing some key parameters the MIDI controller would have, but it works.\n\n    \n    Your browser does not support the video tag.\n\nWhile making this rack, I really got to see the importance of this being a MIDI controller. It's just impossible to have an ergonomic control over everything on display.\nAnd, as you can see in the video, only a single note is being played, but the rack generates full chords using tonal harmonies - that's the core beauty of this whole solution.\nThis still doesn't quite resolve the issue of being able to only play chords with certain intervals, though. What did I do? I decided that it's a problem for the next month and forgot about it. Instead we rolled out our list of features our MIDI controller would offer:\n\n12 keys (1 octave) that generate all the possible chords;\nKnob for adding/removing notes from the chord - I really like this idea of changing the arpeggio size while playing the chords. Really neat way to control the dynamic of the sound;\nKnobs for controlling the base arpeggio parameters:\n\nSpeed;\nDirection;\nGate;\n\n\n8 octave select buttons (basically selecting the highest or the lowest range the notes can go)\nTouch-sensitive keys - function as normal when pressed, but when gliding your finger up and down on the key, the notes in the arpeggio get thrown up an octave or down an octave, gradually;\n12 buttons for selecting the key for the chords;\n4 knobs for mapping the MIDI controller to DAW;\nMajor/minor switch;\nMaster volume knob.\n\nQuite a lot, if you ask me. To finally understand how it would even look like, we made a sketch in Figma, which is a sketch that combined multiple different sketches and ideas provided by Aļika.\nThe Sketch\n\nWe were cutting corners here, as you can see - it's very basic, but contains most of what we want. Although the path seems clearer to me now, there are still so many questions... too many questions.\nI decided to ignore them for now and pretend that everything is alright (I very well knew this was going to shit). Keep in mind, at this moment I had exactly 0 knowledge about electronics or how MIDI devices work whatsoever.\nI tried learning everything by myself, but I realized it's different with hardware than it is with software - you need to have a microprocessor, buttons, switches, potentiometers, wires, etc. I needed to get some Arduino for prototyping, that's as far as my knowledge went. So I started attending a local STEM club as a last resort for help, where the immediate response I got was that it's impossible to do during the given timeframe.\nBeing the biggest baller I am, I still decided that I'm not gonna give all this up and continue working on the idea, even if it doesn't work out in the end. So I got myself an Arduino Uno, a couple potentiometers, breadboard, and some buttons I found on DigiKey (all sponsored by \"MaKE IT\" folks), and started digging my way around the world of Arduino.\nMeanwhile, Davis unexpectedly popped up with the best 3D case design of the MIDI controller I would've never expected. No prior skills in Blender, 2 weeks, just outta nowhere.\nThe 3D model\n\nAlso August was coming to an end and one of the deliverables we undertook was to make a web design for our MIDI controller. So that was also a speedrun from my side.\nThe Web design\n\nThe design consists of a lot of placeholders and doesn't really explain much, but it looks pretty - that's as far as I'm concerned.\nSeptember\nThe intermediate result presentations got delayed... like a lot. We should've already done the presentations in July, but instead they were moved to September.\nThe \"MaKE IT\" project itself expects different solutions and ideas, but I know for a fact that an idea of a cup holder made of refurbished wood shavings would score better than a well-thought prototype of a new music instrument, just because it's marked as eco-frinedly.\nThe only way out would be if I tried to sell the whole MIDI controller idea as much as possible, basically telling that the person watching my presentation needs it. And... I think it worked. But I think the whole selling idea didn't play a huge role in this as it will in the final result presentation. The jury just wanted to see if we're not falling back on our progress.\nAfter the presentation I continued coding the Arduino Uno prototype, just as I ran into a huuge issue - Arduino Uno doesn't support native MIDI signals. What that means is - I have the code that should send the MIDI signal, I have the libraries necessary for that, but the physical Arduino Uno device doesn't have the interface for translating the raw signal into something a computer can pick up as MIDI signal. This is what the STEM guy, Mārtiņš, had warned me about, too.\nAfter an extensive research, I found out that some other Arduino folks had made very basic MIDI controllers using Arduino Uno. In their implementations, there was some common software they used on the computer - Hairless MIDI and loopMIDI. What these programs do is translate the incoming signal from the serial port into a MIDI signal and create a virtual MIDI cable that Ableton or any other DAW can recognize.\nHere's the starter template code for sending MIDI signals through Hairless MIDI and loopMIDI:\n#include &lt;Wire.h&gt;\n#include &lt;MIDI.h&gt;\n\nMIDI_CREATE_DEFAULT_INSTANCE();\n\nint noteON = 144;  // 144 = 10010000 in binary, note on command\nint noteOFF = 128; // 128 = 10000000 in binary, note off command\n\nvoid MIDImessage(int command, int MIDInote, int MIDIvelocity)\n{\n  // send note on or note off command\n  Serial.write(command);\n  // Send pitch data\n  Serial.write(MIDInote);\n  // Send velocity data\n  Serial.write(MIDIvelocity);\n}\n\nvoid setup()\n{\n  // Initialize MIDI\n  MIDI.begin();\n  Serial.begin(115200);\n}\n\n// Send MIDI message through USB port\n\nvoid loop()\n{\n  // Send note on\n  MIDImessage(noteON, 60, velocity); \n\n  // How long the note should play\n  delay(100);\n\n  MIDImessage(noteOFF, 60, 0); // Send note off\n\n  // Delay between each note\n  delay(200);\n}\n\nIt's important to note that HairlessMIDI will not work on a Silicon based Mac. As I was attending the STEM club, I was mainly using my laptop to develop the MIDI controller, so I ended up using SerialMidiBridge by RuudMulder on GitHub and slightly modified it for my needs.\nOctober\n\"MaKE IT\" also offered lectures on different relevant topics that would help us move forwards, and there was no option to skip those lectures, we had to attend them. But we didn't find them useful for our case, so we usually ended up just putting the lecture in the background and continued doing other MIDI controller things.\nThis is the final month, the presentation is on 3rd November. Last month I only figured how I can send the MIDI signal from the MIDI controller to my computer and process it in Ableton, but there was no functionality, no buttons, no knobs, nothing. This was the last moment to make it all work.\nMeeting our last deliverable, I made the schema for the MIDI controller with the help of Mārtiņš. Although I had already wired the MIDI controller before making the schema, I made it anyway and included parts that should be implemented in the future. In the end, it's a mix of what's been done and what should be done, and only I know how far into the schema is the current solution.\nMIDI controller schema\n\nThe thing I found the most confusing was that I needed to think in loops because, in Arduino, the code runs in a big loop constantly. Welp, if you think about it, any server runs in a loop, too. The control flow is just abstracted from it so much that you don't ever need to give it a thought. Oh, and also debugging was not available, since the baud rate is set to 115200 and Arduino IDE debugging console doesn't have the option to listen on that rate. There are definitely other workarounds for that, but I was running low on time and decided that eyeballing the code would be more efficient. And I got really good at that. After like 50 code uploads to my Arduino Uno, it worked just as I wanted.\nThe result\n\nIf you're wondering why there's a slice of bread just laying there, it's because our team name was \"Breadboard\" and because it's funny.\nNovember\nThe final presentation day came way faster than I could notice. We had to wake up at 7am to go to Riga from Ventspils. On the way to Riga, I realized how far we've come and how far I've led my team up until this moment and suddenly felt a huge feeling of responsibility to finish this off in the best way possible. A different type of fear struck me - it wasn't going in front of the class and looking like a fool when presenting, it was about leading the team so far and failing to deliver on the very last step.\nWe were presenting at 1pm. We arrived 30min earlier and got to see a couple other presentations before us, which somehow encouraged me to do better. There was so much going on in my mind and I was kinda floating in the room up until the moment I heard the host call our team name. Our time had come.\nTime flew by when I was speaking, I got lost in my words, not paying attention to how much time's left, and everything felt super tense. There was a huge jury sitting at a round table, everyone's looking right at me. Only halfway through I really got myself together. That's when I kind of felt the audience get more invested in the presentation and realized I got this.\nWe were the last to present, so shortly after a quick break the results were ready. Honestly, at that moment, I was just happy to be there, it felt like a huge responsibility had just been lifted from my shoulders. I just said \"GG WP\" in my mind and smiled as everyone applauded as the host finished the introduction to the awards ceremony. The next moment, I'm standing in front of the room and everyone's applauding for me. We had just won.\nConclusion\nI still don't believe the outcome of this. It happened so fast compared to how long we've been working on this. Almost 6 months of brainstorming, learning, research, work and frustration finalized in under an hour. To this day, I still get this weird bittersweet feeling when thinking back on it, that surely was a new experience.\nMost importantly, though, this project really opened my eyes, just as the other project I participated in with another team 4 years ago did, but this time it was different. I had absolutely no idea how I'd scramble the MIDI controller together and then also program it. This field was blank for me. The same goes for Davis, who created the most impressive 3D model for a person that had no prior experience in Blender nor 3D modelling itself, and Aļika, who got to work in a very dynamic and unpredictable environment and come up with quite unusual solutions in both design and marketing.\n~ Team Maizes Galds (Breadboard)\n","id":"https://notdevkey.github.io/maze-midi/","title":"We built an Arduino MIDI controller, but not your usual MIDI controller."},"https://notdevkey.github.io/setting-up-for-success/":{"body":"A guide on how to (realistically) go big and not go home.\n\n\nWe all have tried. We all have heard about personal development. Yet there are far too many books, guides, frameworks on how to live a better life. What's the problem? Do we really need to read every single personal development book in existence to unlock the best way of living? At what point does it become a 'tutorial hell' and 'self-development porn'?\nFirst and foremost, I want to mention that the personal development and the whole \"sigma grindset\" rabbithole is really deep and you can easily stumble upon redpilled misinformation while still feeling that what you're chasing is right, stagnate and lose yourself. I want this to come as a raw guide that helps you live a simpler life and maybe have something to come back to and realize - it all shouldn't be that complicated. News flash: stay true to yourself. Here we go.\n\"Personal Development is the conscious pursuit of personal growth by expanding self-awareness and knowledge and improving personal skills.\" - as stated by the UK College of Personal Development (didn't know there was a college for that).\nSimple, right?\nPersonal development can be broken down into 3 main components you must acquire for greater success:\n\n\nYour vision - why?\n\n\nYour goals - what?\n\n\nYour values - how?\n\n\nFrom the 'Personal productivity' course by Starweaver - \"When our goals are in harmony with our values, we experience a sense of authenticity and satisfaction.\" It becomes easier to commit to our goals because they represent not just something we want to do, but something we truly believe in. We're all out here on this big flying rock, which inherently has no purpose. So finding your own purpose is actually great for your mental health! 🥳 (also it helps in dealing with existentialism)\nWhy is the alignment of your goals, your vision, and your value so important?\nDirection and focus.\nGoals + vision = clear direction. It guides your focus and helps you avoid any distractions. They remind you where you want to go and keep you on track.\nThis clarity and focus enchances your productivity and effectiveness. Add value in to this equation and it will fuel your motivation. Values make your vision and goals more meaningful to you, and therefore, you're always more committed.\nWhen your goals reflect your values, your actions become consistent with your beliefs. You're not just achieving goals now, you're living your truth, and that's key. So let me debunk...\nSetting goals - \"what?\"\nThere are many, MANY ways to set your goals. There are countless studies on different guides and frameworks to use for goal setting. Truth is, everyone has their own preference and value. Huge tip btw: listen to yourself. It's personal development for a reason.\nHere are some of the most popular frameworks for setting goals:\n\nHoshin Kanri matrix\nO.K.R.s\nI.C.E.\nB.H.A.G. (Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals)\nOne Word Goal\nGoals Pyramid Framework\n\nIf you have heard of SMART goals, you might be wondering why this list is missing it. Personally, I don't view it as a framework, since it's used by many frameworks and is generally just a good practice when it comes to goal setting. Once you get used to SMART goals, you can't go back to DUMB goals. It simply makes no sense. However, you can switch between frameworks. On top of that, many frameworks, like Hoshin Kanri and I.C.E., depend on SMART goals, otherwise they wouldn't serve any purpose.\nSMART goals\nNot all goals are created equal. In order to be truly effective, goals should be SMART.\nSMART is an acronym for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound. As Julian Jenkins said on 'Personal productivity' - \"Setting goals in this technique turns ambitions into clear plans of action, making them more likely to be accomplished.\" The strongest foundamental element to SMART are small successes that enable your feeling of gratitude and accomplishment, which then fuel your motivation and ambition even more!\nTo me, the largest benefit of SMART goals so far has been the value 'achievable' + 'time-bound' criteria bring. It makes sure your goals are not too ambitious. \"Rome was not built in a single day,\" as they say. Time-bound makes you pumped to commit to the task and do it in time, stay to your schedule. I also find these 2 criteria the easiest to fuck up.\nTo give an example, heres a DUMB goal:\n\"I want to get fit.\"\nHere's the same goal transformed into SMART:\n\"I want to improve my fitness by running 3x a week for 30min to improve my health and boost my energy levels.\"\nWhat exactly makes it SMART? Let's break it down:\n\nSpecific - the task goes into detail specifying which aspects it will improve - \"health and energy levels\";\nMeasurable - \"3x a week for 30min\" is a value you can measure very simply using a timer or a smart watch;\nAchievable - if you're a healthy person, running for 30min should not be a task that requires moving mountains, which makes it achievable. 3x of it wouldn't hurt either;\nRelevant - you want to get fit, you have familiarized yourself with the benefits of running, so this task makes very much sense;\nTime-bound - although there is no clear deadline to this task, the time-boundness is in the routine - a week.\n\nThe relevancy of a SMART goal is the trickiest part because only you can make sense of it to yourself. For that, you need to ask yourself - \"why?\"\nThe vision - \"why?\"\nThere's a good rule of thumb I set for myself, and the team lead of my current workplace told me about it - \"your goals can not extend beyond 2 months from now.\"\nWhy is that so?\nWhile 2 months is a brief number, the principle goes that the further you think into the future, the more factors outside of your control will take over. Generally, when you set a big goal, like \"I want to reach $10k/mo MRR in 5 months\" - it might happen, but most likely not. You can get sick, you can get a really good long-term opportunity that requires an immediate onboarding in max. 1 month period, you can get struck by a lightning, ultimately anything. One can only guess.\nVision, on the other hand, is far beyond the 2 month mark - it's the oasis you imagine yourself in when you have achieved the peak of your life. For me the question \"what are you gonna do in 10 years?\" sparks this imagination. For each person it will be different.\nOne thing I highly recommend doing is creating a vision board (haven't done it myself yet, gonna update this blog when I have finished it). Some of my coursemates even have put it as desktop and phone wallpaper to remind themselves about their vision every day. A vision board can be anything - images, text, videos, gifs - that represent your dreams, successes, story, your oasis. It should answer the question - \"Why? Why do I live?\"\nThe values - \"how?\"\nLet me just start this by flexing my value pyramid real quick.\n\nHonestly, putting my values on this pyramid has had a way bigger impact on my goals lately than I would've thought, and I recommend you make one for yourself, too. Values make the most sense organized in a list (or a pyramid) based on how valuable each of them is to you. Your values will change over the time, so their importance will also change. Keep your list updated and make sure you acknowledge it.\nIf you've seen one of these self-fulfillment pyramids previously, you probably know that they don't say much besides showing the general needs of everyone on this planet, which is simply cool to know, I suppose. This pyramid, on the other hand, must resonate with you. I myself had this moment of enlightment when I had laid out all values, went over the pyramid multiple times and realized I don't have a single thing I'd change about it. It just clicked - the pyramid is me, I'm the pyramid.\nYour vision board should already scratch the surface of this. If it doesn't, there's probably some misalignment in the vision board or the value pyramid.\nStrengths\n...is a foundamental element that you should build everything upon.\nAs Peter Drucker emphasizes in his book 'Managing Oneself', playing to your strengths is crucial for achieving success. By understanding and leveraging your strengths, you can maximize your productivity and effectiveness. This approach not only enhances your performance but also boosts your confidence and motivation. When you align your goals with your values and capitalize on your strengths, you create a powerful synergy that propels you towards your aspirations with greater ease and fulfillment.\nYou may be wondering - isn't this just learning a single skill in your life and doing it over and over until success is achieved? Not really. Though you can, of course - it's proven that by choosing a single \"vehicle\" you drive till' success is by far a safer option than jumping \"vehicles\" - as Alex Hormozi likes to phrase it in his lectures. Strengths are not equal to skills, though, don't get it mixed. Strengths you inhibit naturally, but skills, on the other hand, are acquired through a process of learning. Strengths can enhance the application of skills.\nThere's another thing Drucker has to say on this - the only reliable way to discover your strengths is through feedback analysis. This involves:\n\nDocumenting Expectations: Whenever you make a significant decision or take action, write down what you expect the outcome to be.\nReviewing Results: After 9 to 12 months, compare your actual results with your initial expectations. This will help you identify patterns in your performance and clarify where your strengths truly lie.\n\nRealizing your strengths is a hefty task, it takes time and a lot of attention. But when leveraged, it can lead to huge growth.\nPriorities\nThe last thing I want to mention is how to prioritize your goals.\nI've been a huge fan of the belief that \"it's not that you don't have enough time, you simply have set you priorities wrong.\" I often found myself saying \"I didn't have enough time\" in situations where I had taken on a responsibility and failed to deliver in time. Thinking back, I do realize I was producing music the previous day instead of working on the task I was held accountable for.\nEvery single person has their own procrastination tendencies. Countless Youtube videos and books later, I can recommend doing 2 things:\n\nJust fuckin' start doin the ting;\nPomodoro 45-15 (45min work, 15min break).\n\nGoal setting frameworks mentioned earlier can come in handy in prioritization, too. Take, for example, the Hoshin Kanri matrix, where the goals are automatically dissected into smaller and prioritized tasks defined as KPIs (key performance indicators).\nPersonally, I realized that putting your goals into these frameworks every week takes more time and brainpower than using the \"Big rocks first\" method by Stephen Covey. I've already got enough daily stand-ups and catch-ups to sort my priorities in my head or put them into ClickUp. Speaking of ClickUp...\nTask management tools\nA quick disclaimer: task != goal\n\nGoals are overarching aims; tasks are individual actions.\nGoals are typically set for the long term; tasks are often short-term and immediate.\nCompleting a task may bring relief, while achieving a goal usually elicits greater joy and fulfillment\n\nIn simple words: tasks should make up a goal, ideally. How you define your tasks is a very subjective and personal topic. Given your situation, your skills, your capability, it will differ. However, there are few ways you can manage your tasks to enhance your efficiency and save energy.\nI have used these tools:\n\nClickUp - perfect for agile team task management;\nTrello - same shit, but smaller capabilities;\nGoogle Calendar - perfect for keeping a schedule and consistency throughout each day if set up correctly;\nTodoist - perfect for personal tasks and routines, my preference;\nTodo list (physical) - can do anything, probably your go-to if carpal tunnel is not on your wishlist.\n\nMy favorite combo over the last few months has been Google Calendar + Todoist. Google Calendar for daily/weekly routines; Todoist for daily tasks.\nThe framework\nTo summarize everything in a few key points:\n\nGoals vs. Tasks: Goals are long-term and overarching, while tasks are short-term and immediate actions. Completing tasks brings relief, but achieving goals brings joy and fulfillment.\nTask Management Tools: Use tools like ClickUp for agile team management, Trello for simpler task management, Google Calendar for scheduling, Todoist for personal tasks, and physical todo lists if you prefer writing by hand.\nSMART Goals: Ensure your goals are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound to turn ambitions into clear plans of action.\nVision: Your vision should be a long-term aspiration, something that keeps you motivated and focused. Consider creating a vision board to visualize your dreams and goals.\nValues: Align your goals with your values to ensure your actions are consistent with your beliefs. This alignment fuels motivation and commitment.\nPrioritization: Prioritize your goals effectively. Use frameworks like Hoshin Kanri or the \"Big rocks first\" method to manage your priorities and avoid procrastination.\nStrengths: Leverage your strengths to maximize productivity and effectiveness. Identify your strengths through self-assessment and feedback, and incorporate them into your daily tasks and long-term goals.\n\nImplementation\n\nStart with your vision—a long-term aspiration that keeps you motivated.\nDefine your values to ensure your goals align with your beliefs and principles.\nSet SMART goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound to create a clear plan of action.\nLeverage your strengths by identifying them through self-assessment and feedback, and incorporating them into your tasks and goals.\nPrioritize your goals and tasks effectively to stay focused and avoid procrastination.\n\nDon't overcomplicate it.\nThis blog post is a guide I made for myself to keep me going during darker times. I'm gonna update it as time goes on and I find out I was wrong. That's the beauty of improving. If you're reading this, I hope you, too, can learn and apply some of the mentioned methods. If it doesn't work, well, everyone has to figure it out for themselves.

While there's plenty of advice out there about entrepreneurship, I wanted to focus specifically on sustainable approaches for one-person operations. Here's what I learned about building and managing a successful solo business.\n\n\nThe Reality of Solo Business\nThe entrepreneurial world loves to promote an idealized version of running your own business:\nMultitasking GIFfrom Spongebob GIFs \nThe truth is, successful solo businesses aren't built on superhuman abilities or 20-hour workdays. They're built on robust systems, clear boundaries, and sustainable practices.\nBackground\nFor the Business Management course in Business Academy, I set out to explore the wilderness of running a solo business, as I've been moving into this direction for the last 3 years. I have a solid background as a designer and indie hacker (fancy way to say a software developer without a job (I do have a job but dreaming to not have one)). In Business Academy, my initial goal was to learn the entrepreneurship needed for combining these powers and create a business all by myself. That's kind of my personal checkmark to be sure that I will be just fine if I end up homeless - I have all the skills to quickstart a business.\nThe Software Solopreneur's Reality\nThe software industry presents unique opportunities and challenges for solo businesses. While the barrier to entry is relatively low (you mainly need a laptop and internet), the competition is fierce. From my research and experience in the field, I've identified several key aspects that particularly matter for software solopreneurs:\n\nTechnical Debt vs Business Growth: The constant battle between writing perfect code and shipping features fast enough to keep customers happy.\nThe Full-Stack Challenge: Being responsible for everything from backend architecture to user interface design.\nRapid Technology Evolution: Staying relevant while not getting caught up in every new framework or tool.\n\nEssential Systems for Solo Operations\n1. Time Management Systems\nResearch shows that effective time management in solo businesses relies on three key principles:\n\nEnergy-Based Scheduling: Track and plan work around your natural energy cycles. Most people have 2-3 peak productivity windows during the day.\nContext Minimization: Studies indicate task-switching can consume up to 40% of productive time. Group similar tasks to reduce context switches.\nProactive Planning: Dedicate time for weekly planning to prevent reactive work patterns.\n\n2. Financial Management Framework\nBased on analysis of successful solo businesses, here's a proven financial structure:\n\nRevenue Allocation Model: \n\n30% for taxes (adjust based on your jurisdiction)\n30% for operating expenses\n30% for owner compensation\n10% for contingency fund\n\n\nWeekly Financial Review Checklist:\n\nRevenue tracking\nExpense monitoring\nCash flow projections\nProfitability analysis\n\n\n\n3.

The book challenges traditional growth metrics and focuses on optimization over expansion - an approach I've found particularly relevant for solo operations.\nCritical Success Factors\nBased on research and industry analysis:\n\nSystems trump motivation\nBoundaries enable growth\nAutomation preserves energy\nSupport networks ensure longevity\nSustainable practices beat short-term gains\n\nConsiderations as a software solopreneur\nHaving studied successful software solopreneurs, I've noticed some patterns that seem particularly relevant for my journey:\nDevelopment Workflow\n\nMVP Strategy: Build the minimum viable product that solves the core problem\nIterative Development: Release early, gather feedback, improve continuously\nTechnical Architecture: Choose scalable but manageable technologies\nCode Management: Maintain clean, documented, and maintainable code\nTesting Strategy: Automated testing to prevent critical failures\n\nProduct Management\n\nFeature Prioritization: Focus on high-impact, low-effort features first\nUser Feedback Loop: Build mechanisms for gathering and acting on user feedback\nVersion Control: Proper git workflow and release management\nDocumentation: Both for users and for future maintenance\nSupport System: Efficient way to handle user issues and questions\n\nIn Financial Management Framework:\nI've found that software businesses have unique financial considerations. While the operational costs might be lower than traditional businesses, there are hidden costs like:\n\nCloud services and hosting\nDevelopment tools and licenses\nContinuous learning resources\nMarketing automation tools\n\nIn Marketing and Brand Building:\nFor software products, I've learned that marketing often needs to be more technical and educational:\n\nDeveloper-focused content marketing\nTechnical documentation as marketing\nOpen source contributions for visibility\nDeveloper community engagement\nTechnical webinars and tutorials\n\nThe Software Stack Reality\nAs a software solopreneur, your technology choices can make or break your business. From my research, successful solo developers often:\n\nChoose Boring Technology: Proven, stable technologies over cutting-edge ones\nLeverage Platform as a Service: Use managed services to reduce operational overhead\nAutomate Everything: From testing to deployment to monitoring\nBuild on Open Source: Use and contribute to open source to reduce development costs\nPlan for Scale: Choose architecture that can grow without requiring a team\n\nFinal Insights\nAfter studying numerous solo business models and relating them to my software development background, I've concluded that success in solo software business isn't about being the best coder - it's about being the most effective business operator who can code. The most successful software solopreneurs aren't necessarily those who write the cleanest code or use the latest technologies, but those who:\n\nBuild systems that scale without requiring constant attention\nFocus on solving real problems rather than building cool technology\nMaintain a balance between technical excellence and business needs\nCreate sustainable practices that prevent burnout\nStay connected to their user community\n\nThe key isn't to build the perfect software - it's to build software that solves problems while building a business that sustains itself.\nCompany of One by Paul Jarvis\nMacroeconomics for Business Management\n","id":"https://notdevkey.github.io/solo-business/","title":"Managing a solo business without losing your mind"},"https://notdevkey.github.io/user-service-hooking/":{"body":"In today's customer-centric landscape, service design has emerged as a critical approach to creating meaningful, habit-forming solutions that truly address customer pain points. By leveraging design thinking principles and understanding the psychological aspects of habit formation, service designers can create experiences that not only solve problems but become integrated into users' daily routines.\n\nUnderstanding Service Design\nService design is the practice of planning and organizing people, infrastructure, communication, and material components of a service to improve its quality and the interaction between the service provider and its customers. It's a holistic approach that considers the entire user journey, identifying pain points and opportunities for innovation.\nWhat separates great service design from mere problem-solving is the ability to create solutions that users not only need but develop habits around. When a service becomes habitual, it creates a powerful bond with users that drives loyalty and continuous engagement.\nThe Power of Design Thinking\nAt the core of effective service design is design thinking—a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from the designer's toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.\n\nThe design thinking process typically involves five key phases:\n\nEmpathize: Deeply understanding user needs through research\nDefine: Identifying and articulating the core problem\nIdeate: Generating creative solutions\nPrototype: Building representations of potential solutions\nTest: Evaluating and refining the solutions\n\nThis approach ensures that the solutions developed are grounded in real user needs and behaviors rather than assumptions or business requirements alone.\nCreating Customer Personas\nOne of the most powerful tools in the service designer's arsenal is the customer persona. A persona is a semi-fictional representation of your ideal customer based on market research and real data about your existing customers.\nEffective personas include:\n\nDemographic information (age, location, job title)\nGoals and challenges\nValues and fears\nBehavioral patterns\nPreferences and pain points\n\nBy developing detailed personas, service designers can better understand who they're designing for and make more informed decisions throughout the design process. This understanding forms the foundation for identifying genuine pain points and creating solutions that users will actually adopt.\nMapping the Customer Journey\nOnce you have established clear personas, the next step is to map their journey. A customer journey map is a visual representation of the process a customer goes through to achieve a goal with your service. It helps identify:\n\n\nKey touchpoints where users interact with your service\nPain points that cause frustration or barriers\nEmotional highs and lows throughout the experience\nGaps in the current service offering\nOpportunities for innovation\n\nJourney maps typically track the experience across multiple phases:\n\nAwareness: How customers discover the service\nConsideration: How they evaluate options\nDecision: What triggers them to choose your service\nOnboarding: Their initial experience\nUsage: Ongoing interaction with the service\nSupport: Problem resolution experiences\nLoyalty/Advocacy: Long-term relationship development\n\nThe power of journey mapping lies in its ability to shift perspective from an organization-centric view to a customer-centric one. It forces service designers to walk in their users' shoes, experiencing the service as they would.\nIdentifying Pain Points at Different Levels\nPain points exist at multiple levels of the customer experience:\n\nInteraction-level pain points: Usability issues that create friction during specific interactions\nJourney-level pain points: Problems that emerge across the entire process of achieving a goal\nRelationship-level pain points: Issues that affect the overall long-term relationship with the service\n\nIdentifying these pain points requires a mix of research methods:\n\nFor interaction-level pain points: Usability testing, analytics, and heatmaps\nFor journey-level pain points: Customer interviews, diary studies, and journey mapping\nFor relationship-level pain points: Longitudinal studies, NPS surveys, and customer satisfaction metrics\n\nThe most valuable solutions often address pain points at multiple levels, creating seamless experiences that build trust over time.\nCreating Habit-Forming Solutions\nOnce you've identified your users' pain points, the next challenge is designing solutions that not only address these problems but become integrated into users' routines. This is where the insights from Nir Eyal's book \"Hooked\" become particularly valuable.\nIn \"Hooked,\" Eyal presents the Hook Model—a four-phase process that companies use to build habit-forming products:\n\nTrigger: The actuator of behavior (external or internal)\nAction: The behavior done in anticipation of a reward\nVariable Reward: The reason the user performs the action\nInvestment: Where users put something into the product to improve their experience\n\nAs Eyal writes in \"Hooked\": \n\n\"Through consecutive hook cycles, successful products reach their ultimate goal of unprompted user engagement, bringing users back repeatedly without depending on costly advertising or aggressive messaging.\"\n\nThis model provides a framework for creating services that users turn to automatically. By designing your service with these four phases in mind, you can create solutions that become habits.\nApplying the Hook Model to Service Design\nLet's explore how the Hook Model can be applied to service design:\n1. Trigger\nEffective triggers prompt users to engage with your service. External triggers include notifications, emails, or word-of-mouth recommendations. Internal triggers associate your service with existing routines or emotions (like boredom, frustration, or curiosity).\nWhen designing a service, identify the moments when users most acutely feel the pain point you're addressing. These moments are perfect opportunities for triggers.\n2. Action\nThe action phase must be as simple as possible. According to Eyal, \"for any behavior to occur, a person must have sufficient motivation, sufficient ability, and an effective trigger.\" When the action requires minimal effort and addresses a clear need, users are more likely to engage.\nIn service design, this means reducing friction at critical touchpoints and ensuring that the value proposition is immediately apparent.\n3. Variable Reward\nVariable rewards keep users engaged by creating a sense of anticipation and satisfaction. These can take three forms:\n\nRewards of the Tribe: Social validation and connection\nRewards of the Hunt: Material resources and information\nRewards of the Self: Mastery, completion, and competence\n\nBy incorporating elements of unpredictability and delight into your service, you can make the experience more engaging and habit-forming.\n4. Investment\nThe investment phase is where users put something into the service, increasing their commitment and the likelihood of returning. This could be time, data, effort, social capital, or money.\n\nAs Eyal notes:\n\n\"The more users invest in a product, the more likely they are to value it. When we work on a task, we value it more highly the more effort we put into it.\"\n\nIn service design, create opportunities for users to customize their experience, build profiles, contribute content, or form connections. These investments make the service more valuable over time and increase switching costs.\nReal-World Example: Designing a Healthcare Appointment Service\nLet's consider how these principles might apply to designing a healthcare appointment service:\n\n\nPersona Development: Research reveals that busy professionals struggle to manage routine healthcare appointments due to unpredictable work schedules.\n\n\nJourney Mapping: Mapping the current journey shows major pain points around scheduling appointments during business hours and long wait times even after arrival.\n\n\nPain Point Identification: The core pain points include difficulty in scheduling, uncertainty about wait times, and inefficient use of waiting time.\n\n\nHook-Based Solution Design:\n\nTrigger: SMS reminders when preventive care is due, with easy scheduling links\nAction: One-click appointment booking with preferred time slots\nVariable Reward: Real-time updates on wait times and \"virtual line\" position\nInvestment: Health profile building and appointment preferences that improve with use\n\n\n\nThis solution addresses the identified pain points while building habit loops that encourage regular engagement with preventive healthcare.\n\nCreating Emotional Bonds Through Service Design\nThe ultimate goal of service design isn't just to solve problems but to create emotional bonds with users. When a service consistently addresses pain points and becomes habitual, it transforms from a mere utility into an essential part of users' lives.\nThis emotional connection happens when:\n\nThe service reliably solves a significant pain point\nIt becomes integrated into daily routines through the Hook Model\nIt evolves based on user investment and feedback\nIt maintains consistency while continuously improving\n\nAs Nir Eyal points out in \"Hooked\": \n\n\"Habit-forming products change user behavior and create unprompted user engagement. The aim is to influence customers to use your product on their own, repeatedly, without relying on overt calls to action such as ads or promotions.\"\n\nConclusion: From Pain Points to Habits\nService design is ultimately about understanding human needs deeply enough to create solutions that not only address pain points but become integrated into users' lives. By combining design thinking principles with the psychology of habit formation, designers can create services that users turn to automatically.\nThe process requires empathy, research, and a commitment to continuous iteration. It means mapping journeys, identifying pain points, and designing solutions that trigger, enable action, reward engagement, and encourage investment.\nWhen done effectively, service design doesn't just solve problems—it creates experiences that users come to depend on and develop emotional connections with. In a crowded marketplace, this habit-forming quality may be the most significant differentiator between services that simply work and those that truly transform the user experience.\nRemember that the ultimate measure of successful service design isn't just user satisfaction but behavioral change. When your solution becomes part of users' routines—when they turn to it automatically in response to a need—you've created something truly valuable.\nCreative Design, Prototyping, and Testing\nHooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products by Nir Eyal\n","id":"https://notdevkey.github.io/user-service-hooking/","title":"The Art of Service Design: Creating Solutions That Become Habits"}},"docInfo":{"https://notdevkey.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://notdevkey.github.io/analytics-journey/":{"body":642,"title":5},"https://notdevkey.github.io/biggest-mistake/":{"body":658,"title":4},"https://notdevkey.github.io/bookkeeping-cooperative/":{"body":852,"title":6},"https://notdevkey.github.io/copyright-money/":{"body":1682,"title":4},"https://notdevkey.github.io/going-against-the-curve/":{"body":1999,"title":7},"https://notdevkey.github.io/hello-world/":{"body":52,"title":2},"https://notdevkey.github.io/leader-framework/":{"body":1562,"title":6},"https://notdevkey.github.io/managing-affiliate-finances/":{"body":685,"title":5},"https://notdevkey.github.io/maze-midi/":{"body":1501,"title":7},"https://notdevkey.github.io/setting-up-for-success/":{"body":1339,"title":6},"https://notdevkey.github.io/solo-business/":{"body":1175,"title":6},"https://notdevkey.github.io/user-service-hooking/":{"body":1055,"title":7}},"length":13},"lang":"English"};
