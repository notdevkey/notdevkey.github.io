My name is Ronald, and at the time I'm writing this, I'm 18. I live in a lonely but calm place by the Baltic sea, in Latvia. I never liked big city life either way.

That's it. I won't tell anything more about myself for now because else I'd make it boring for you. But I've surely got to show you something.

Every remarkable step in my carreer as a software developer, designer and music producer will be documented here. I hope you'll be able to learn what to do, and most importantly - what not to do.
